<a name="PREFACE"></a><h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>It is with some hesitation that I offer this volume to the scientific
public. The text of the ancient songs which it contains offers
extreme and peculiar difficulties to the translator, and I have been
obliged to pursue the task without assistance of any kind. Not a line
of them has ever before been rendered into an European tongue, and my
endeavors to obtain aid from some of the Nahuatl scholars of Mexico
have, for various reasons, proved ineffectual. I am therefore alone
responsible for errors and misunderstandings.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I have felt that these monuments of ancient native
literature are so interesting in themselves, and so worthy of
publication, that they should be placed at the disposition of
scholars in their original form with the best rendering that I could
give them at present, rather than to await the uncertain event of
years for a better.</p>

<p>The text itself may be improved by comparison with the original MS.
and with the copy previously made by the Licentiate Chimalpopoca,
referred to on page 48. My own efforts in this direction have been
confined to a faithful reproduction in print of the MS. copy of the
Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg.</p>

<p>The Notes, which might easily have been extended, I have confined
within moderate compass, so as not to enlarge unduly the bulk of the
volume.</p>

<p>To some, the Vocabulary may seem inadequate. I assume that those
persons who wish to make a critical study of the original text will
provide themselves with the Nahuatl Dictionaries of Molina or Siméon,
both of which are now easily obtainable, thanks to Mr. Julius
Platzmann for the reprint of Molina. I also assume that such students
will acquaint themselves with the rules of grammar and laws of
word-building of the tongue, and that they will use the vocabulary
merely as a labor-saving means of reaching the themes of compounds
and unusual forms of words. Employed in this manner, it will, I hope,
be found adequate.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would mention that there is a large body of Nahuatl
literature yet unpublished, both prose and poetry, modern and
ancient, and as the Nahuatl tongue is one of the most highly
developed on the American continent, it is greatly to be desired that
all this material should be at the command of students. The Nahuatl,
moreover, is not a difficult tongue; for an Englishman or a
Frenchman, I should say it is easier to acquire than German, its
grammar being simple and regular, and its sounds soft and sonorous.
It has special recommendations, therefore, to one who would acquaint
himself with an American language.</p>

<h1>ANCIENT NAHUATL POETRY.</h1>

<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a><h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<a name="S_1"></a><h3>§ 1. <i>THE NATIONAL LOVE OF POETRY.</i></h3>

<p>The passionate love with which the Nahuas cultivated song, music and
the dance is a subject of frequent comment by the historians of
Mexico. These arts are invariably mentioned as prominent features of
the aboriginal civilization; no public ceremony was complete without
them; they were indispensable in the religious services held in the
temples; through their assistance the sacred and historical
traditions were preserved; and the entertainments of individuals
received their chief lustre and charm from their association with
these arts.</p>

<p>The profession of the poet stood in highest honor. It was the custom
before the Conquest for every town, every ruler and every person of
importance to maintain a company of singers and dancers, paying them
fixed salaries, and the early writer, Duran, tells us that this
custom continued in his own time, long after the Conquest. He
sensibly adds, that he can see nothing improper in it, although it
was condemned by some of the Spaniards.<a name="fn01_r"></a><a href="#fn01"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> In the training of these
artists their patrons took a deep personal interest, and were not at
all tolerant of neglected duties. We are told that the chief selected
the song which was to be sung, and the tune by which it was to be
accompanied; and did any one of the choir sing falsely, a drummer
beat out of time, or a dancer strike an incorrect attitude, the
unfortunate artist was instantly called forth, placed in bonds and
summarily executed the next morning!<a name="fn02_r"></a><a href="#fn02"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a></p>

<p>With critics of such severity to please, no wonder that it was
necessary to begin the training early, and to set apart for it
definite places and regular teachers. Therefore it was one of the
established duties of the teachers in the calmecac or public school,
"to teach the pupils all the verses of the sacred songs which were
written in characters in their books."<a name="fn03_r"></a><a href="#fn03"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> There were also special
schools, called <i>cuicoyan</i>, singing places, where both sexes were
taught to sing the popular songs and to dance to the sound of the
drums.<a name="fn04_r"></a><a href="#fn04"><sup><small>4</small></sup></a>
 In the public ceremonies it was no uncommon occurrence for
the audience to join in the song and dance until sometimes many
thousands would thus be seized with the contagion of the rhythmical
motion, and pass hours intoxicated (to use a favorite expression of
the Nahuatl poets) with the cadence and the movement.</p>

<p>After the Conquest the Church set its face firmly against the
continuance of these amusements. Few of the priests had the liberal
views of Father Duran, already quoted; most of them were of the
opinion of Torquemada, who urges the clergy "to forbid the singing of
the ancient songs, because all of them are full of idolatrous
memories, or of diabolical and suspicious allusions of the same
character."<a name="fn05_r"></a><a href="#fn05"><sup><small>5</small></sup></a></p>

<p>To take the place of the older melodies, the natives were taught the
use of the musical instruments introduced by the Spaniards, and very
soon acquired no little proficiency, so that they could perform upon
them, compose original pieces, and manufacture most of the
instruments themselves.<a name="fn06_r"></a><a href="#fn06"><sup><small>6</small></sup></a></p>

<p>To this day the old love of the song and dance continues in the
Indian villages; and though the themes are changed, the forms remain
with little alteration. Travelers describe the movements as slow, and
consisting more in bending and swaying the body than in motions of
the feet; while the songs chanted either refer to some saint or
biblical character, or are erotic and pave the way to orgies.<a name="fn07_r"></a><a href="#fn07"><sup><small>7</small></sup></a></p>

<a name="S_2"></a><h3>§ 2. <i>THE POET AND HIS WORK.</i></h3>

<p>The Nahuatl word for a song or poem is <i>cuicatl</i>. It is derived from
the verb <i>cuica</i>, to sing, a term probably imitative or
onomatopoietic in origin, as it is also a general expression for the
twittering of birds. The singer was called <i>cuicani</i>, and is
distinguished from the composer of the song, the poet, to whom was
applied the term <i>cuicapicqui</i>, in which compound the last member,
<i>picqui</i>, corresponds strictly to the Greek &pi;&omicron;&iota;&eta;&tau;&#8052;&#962;,
being a derivative of <i>piqui</i>, to make, to create.<a name="fn08_r"></a><a href="#fn08"><sup><small>8</small></sup></a> Sometimes he
was also called <i>cuicatlamantini</i>, "skilled in song."</p>

<p>It is evident from these words, all of which belong to the ancient
language, that the distinction between the one who composed the poems
and those who sang them was well established, and that the Nahuatl
poetry was, therefore, something much above mere improvisation, as
some have thought. This does not alter the fact that a professed bard
usually sang songs of his own composition, as well as those obtained
from other sources. This is obvious from the songs in this
collection, many of which contain the expression <i>ni cuicani</i>, I, the
singer, which also refers to the maker of the song.</p>

<p>In the classical work of Sahagun, the author describes the ancient
poet: "The worthy singer has a clear mind and a strong memory. He
composes songs himself and learns those of others, and is always
ready to impart either to the fellows of his craft. He sings with a
well-trained voice, and is careful to practice in private before he
appears before the public. The unworthy singer, on the other hand, is
ignorant and indolent. What he learns he will not communicate to
others. His voice is hoarse and untrained, and he is at once envious
and boastful."<a name="fn09_r"></a><a href="#fn09"><sup><small>9</small></sup></a></p>

<a name="S_3"></a><h3>§ 3. <i>THE THEMES AND CLASSES OF THE SONGS.</i></h3>

<p>From what he could learn about them some two centuries or more after
the Conquest, the antiquary Boturini classified all the ancient songs
under two general heads, the one treating mainly of historical
themes, while the other was devoted to purely fictitious, emotional
or imaginative subjects.<a name="fn10_r"></a><a href="#fn10"><sup><small>10</small></sup></a> His terse classification is expanded by
the Abbé Clavigero, who states that the themes of the ancient poets
were various, some chanting the praises of the gods or petitioning
them for favors, others recalled the history of former generations,
others were didactic and inculcated correct habits of life, while
others, finally, were in lighter vein, treating of hunting, games and
love.<a name="fn11_r"></a><a href="#fn11"><sup><small>11</small></sup></a></p>

<p>His remarks were probably a generalization from a chapter in
Torquemada's <i>Monarquia Indiana</i>, in which that writer states that
the songs at the sacred festivals differed in subject with the
different months and seasons. Thus, in the second month of their
calendar, at its stated festival, the people sang the greatness of
their rulers; in the seventh month all the songs were of love, of
women, or of hunting; in the eighth the chants recalled the noble
deeds of their ancestors and their divine origin; while in the ninth
month nothing was heard but verses fraught with lamentation for the
dead.<a name="fn12_r"></a><a href="#fn12"><sup><small>12</small></sup></a> With less minuteness, Father Duran gives almost the same
information. He himself had often heard the songs which Montezuma of
Tenochtitlan, and Nezahualpizintli of Tezcuco, had ordered to be
composed in their own honor, describing their noble lineage, their
riches, their grandeur and their victories. These songs were in his
day still sung at the public dances of the natives, and he adds,
"although they were filled with laudation of their ancient rulers, it
gave me much pleasure to hear the praises of such grandeur." There
were other poets, he observes, who lived in the temples and composed
songs exclusively in honor of the gods.<a name="fn13_r"></a><a href="#fn13"><sup><small>13</small></sup></a></p>

<p>These general expressions may be supplemented by a list of terms,
specifying particular classes of songs, preserved by various writers.
These are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>melahuacuicatl</i>: this is translated by Tezozomoc, "a straight and
true song."<a name="fn14_r"></a><a href="#fn14"><sup><small>14</small></sup></a> It is a compound of <i>melahuac</i>, straight, direct,
true; and <i>cuicatl</i>, song. It was a beginning or opening song at the
festivals, and apparently derived its name from its greater
intelligibility and directness of expression. A synonym, derived from
the same root, is <i>tlamelauhcayotl</i>, which appears in the title to
some of the songs in the present collection.</p>

<p><i>xopancuicatl</i>: this term is spelled by Ixtlilxochitl,
<i>xompacuicatl</i>, and explained to mean "a song of the spring" (from
<i>xopan</i>, springtime, <i>cuicatl</i>, song). The expression seems to be
figurative, referring to the beginning or early life of things. Thus,
the prophetic songs of Nezahualcoyotl, those which he sang when he
laid the foundation of his great palace, bore this name.<a name="fn15_r"></a><a href="#fn15"><sup><small>15</small></sup></a></p>

<p><i>teuccuicatl</i>: songs of the nobles (<i>teuctli</i>, <i>cuicatl</i>). These were
also called <i>quauhcuicatl</i>, "eagle songs," the term <i>quauhtli</i>,
eagle, being applied to distinguished persons.</p>

<p><i>xochicuicatl</i>: flower-song, one singing the praises of flowers.</p>

<p><i>icnocuicatl</i>: song of destitution or compassion.</p>

<p><i>noteuhcuicaliztli</i>: "the song of my lords." This appears to be a
synonymous expression for <i>teuccuicatl</i>; it is mentioned by Boturini,
who adds that on the day sacred to the god Xiuhteuctli the king began
the song so called.<a name="fn16_r"></a><a href="#fn16"><sup><small>16</small></sup></a></p>

<p><i>miccacuicatl</i>: the song for the dead (<i>miqui</i>, to die, <i>cuicatl</i>).
In this solemn chant the singers were seated on the ground, and their
hair was twisted in plaits around their heads.<a name="fn17_r"></a><a href="#fn17"><sup><small>17</small></sup></a></p>

<p>In addition to the above terms drawn from the subject or character of
the songs, there were others, of geographical origin, apparently
indicating that the song, or its tune, or its treatment was borrowed
from another locality or people. These are:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Huexotzincayotl</i>: a song of Huexotzinco, a Nahuatl town, situated
east of the Lake of Tezcuco. This song was sung by the king and
superior nobles at certain festivals, and, in the prescribed order of
the chants, followed a <i>melahuaccuicatl</i>.<a name="fn18_r"></a><a href="#fn18"><sup><small>18</small></sup></a></p>

<p><i>Chalcayotl</i>: a song of Chalco, on the lake of the same name. This
followed the last mentioned in order of time at the festivals.</p>

<p><i>Otoncuicatl</i>: a song of the Otomis. These were the immediate
neighbors of the Nahuas, but spoke a language radically diverse. The
songs so-called were sung fourth on the list.</p>

<p><i>Cuextecayotl</i>: a song of the country of the Cuexteca, or Cuextlan, a
northern province of Mexico.</p>

<p><i>Tlauancacuextecayotl</i>: a song of the country of the
Tlauancacuexteca.</p>

<p><i>Anahuacayotl</i>: a song of Anahuac, that is, of a country near the
water, either the valley of Mexico, or the shores of the ocean.</p>

<p>Some very ancient sacred songs were referred to by Tezozomoc as
peculiar to the worship of Huitzilopochtli, and, indeed, introduced
by this potent divinity. From their names, <i>cuitlaxoteyotl</i>, and
<i>tecuilhuicuicatl</i>,<a name="fn19_r"></a><a href="#fn19"><sup><small>19</small></sup></a> I judge that they referred to some of those
pederastic rites which still prevail extensively among the natives of
the pueblos of New Mexico, and which have been described by Dr.
William A. Hammond and other observers.<a name="fn20_r"></a><a href="#fn20"><sup><small>20</small></sup></a> One of these songs began,</p>

<p>But the old chronicler, who doubtless knew it all by heart, gives us
no more of it.<a name="fn21_r"></a><a href="#fn21"><sup><small>21</small></sup></a></p>

<a name="S_4"></a><h3>§ 4. <i>PROSODY OF THE SONGS.</i></h3>

<p>The assertion is advanced by Boturini that the genuine ancient
Nahuatl poetry which has been preserved is in iambic metre, and he
refers to a song of Nezahualcoyotl in his collection to prove his
opinion. What study I have given to the prosody of the Nahuatl tongue
leads me to doubt the correctness of so sweeping a statement. The
vocalic elements of the language have certain peculiarities which
prevent its poetry from entering unencumbered into the domain of
classical prosody.</p>

<p>The quantity of Nahuatl syllables is a very important element in the
pronunciation of the tongue, but their quantity is not confined, as
in Latin, to long, short, and common. The Nahuatl vowels are long,
short, intermediate, and "with stress," or as the Spanish grammarians
say, "with a jump," <i>con saltillo</i>. The last mentioned is peculiar to
this tongue. The vowel so designated is pronounced with a momentary
suspension or catching of the breath, rendering it emphatic.</p>

<p>These quantities are prominent features in the formal portions of the
language, characterizing inflections and declinations. No common
means of designating them have been adopted by the grammarians, and
for my present purpose, I shall make use of the following signs:&mdash;</p>

<center>
<table style="width: 10%">
  <tbody style="vertical-align: top">
    <tr> <td>&#259;</td> <td>,</td> <td>short.</td>       </tr>
    <tr> <td>a</td>     <td>,</td> <td>intermediate</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>&#257;</td> <td>,</td> <td>long.</td>        </tr>
    <tr> <td>â</td>     <td>,</td> <td>with stress.</td> </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</center>

<p>The general prosodic rules are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. In polysyllabic words in which there are no long vowels, all the
vowels are intermediate.</p>

<p>2. The vowels are long in the penultimate of the plurals of the
imperatives when the preterit of the verb ends in a vowel; the <i>&#257;</i>
of the <i>c&#257;n</i> of the imperatives; the <i>&#299;</i> of the <i>t&#299;</i>; of the
gerundives; the last vowel of the futures when the verb loses a vowel
to form them; the penultimates of passives in <i>lo</i>, of impersonals,
of verbals in <i>oni</i>, <i>illi</i>, <i>olli</i> and <i>oca</i>, of verbal nouns with
the terminations <i>yan</i> and <i>can</i>; the <i>&#333;</i> of abstract nouns in
<i>otl</i> in composition; and those derived from long syllables.</p>

<p>3. Vowels are "with stress" when they are the finals in the plurals
of nouns and verbs, also in the perfect preterite, in possessives
ending in â, ê, ô, and in the penultimate of nouns ending in <i>tli</i>,
<i>tla</i> and <i>tle</i> when these syllables are immediately preceded by the
vowel.<a name="fn22_r"></a><a href="#fn22"><sup><small>22</small></sup></a></p>

<p>The practical importance of these distinctions may be illustrated by
the following examples:&mdash;</p>

<table style="width: 10%">
  <tbody style="vertical-align: top">
    <tr> <td><i>tâtli</i></td>         <td>,</td> <td>father.</td>        </tr>
    <tr> <td><i>t&#257;tl&#301;</i></td> <td>,</td> <td>thou drinkest.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td><i>t&#257;tlî</i></td>     <td>,</td> <td>we drink.</td>      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</center>

<p>It is, however, evident from this example that the quantity of
Nahuatl syllables enters too much into the strictly formal part of
the language for rules of position, such as some of those above
given, to be binding; and doubtless for this reason the eminent
grammarian Carlos de Tapia Zenteno, who was professor of the tongue
in the University of Mexico, denies that it can be reduced to
definite rules of prosody like those of the Latin.
<a name="fn23_r"></a><a href="#fn23"><sup><small>23</small></sup></a></p>

<p>Substituting accent for quantity, there would seem to be an iambic
character to the songs. Thus the first words of Song I, were probably
chanted:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Nino' yolno' notza' campa' nic&#365; iz' yec tli' ahui aca' xochitl'</i>:
etc.</p>

<p>But the directions given for the drums at the beginning of Songs
XVIII, XIX, etc., do not indicate a continuance of these feet, but of
others, as in XIX:&mdash;</p>

<p>u&mdash;, u&mdash;, u&mdash;, uu&mdash;, u&mdash;, u&mdash;, u&mdash;, etc.</p>

<p>Indeed, we may suppose that the metre varied with the subject and the
skill of the poet. This, in fact, is the precise statement of Father
Duran,<a name="fn24_r"></a><a href="#fn24"><sup><small>24</small></sup></a> who speaks of the native poets as "giving to each song a
different tune (<i>sonada</i>), as we are accustomed in our poetry to have
the sonnet, the octava rima and the terceto."</p>

<a name="S_5"></a><h3>§ 5. <i>THE VOCAL DELIVERY OF THE SONG.</i></h3>

<p>Descriptions of the concerts so popular among the Nahuas have been
preserved by the older writers, and it is of the highest importance
to understand their methods in order to appreciate the songs
presented in this volume.</p>

<p>These concerts were held on ceremonial occasions in the open air, in
the village squares or in the courtyards of the houses. They began in
the morning and usually continued until nightfall, occasionally far
into the night. The musicians occupied the centre of the square and
the trained singers stood or sat around them. When the sign was given
to begin, the two most skillful singers, sometimes a man and a woman,
pronounced the first syllables of the song slowly but with a sharp
emphasis;<a name="fn25_r"></a><a href="#fn25"><sup><small>25</small></sup></a>then
the drums began in a low tone, and gradually increased in
strength as the song proceeded; the other singers united their voices
until the whole chorus was in action, and often the bystanders, to
the numbers of thousands, would ultimately join in the words of some
familiar song, keeping time by concerted movements of the hands and
feet.</p>

<p>Each verse or couplet of the song was repeated three or four times
before proceeding to the next, and those songs which were of the
slowest measure and least emotional in character were selected for
the earlier hours of the festivals. None of the songs was lengthy,
even the longest, in spite of the repetitions, rarely lasting over an
hour.<a name="fn26_r"></a><a href="#fn26"><sup><small>26</small></sup></a></p>

<p>The tone in which the words were chanted is described by Clavigero,
Mühlenpfordt and other comparatively recent travelers as harsh,
strident and disagreeable to the European ear. Mendieta calls it a
"contra-bass," and states that persons gifted with such a voice
cultivated it assiduously and were in great demand. The Nahuas call
it <i>tozquitl</i>, the singing voice, and likened it to the notes of
sweet singing birds.</p>

<a name="S_6"></a><h3>§ 6. <i>THE INSTRUMENTAL ACCOMPANIMENT.</i></h3>

<p>The Nahuas were not acquainted with any stringed instrument. They
manufactured, however, a variety of objects from which they could
extract what seemed to them melodious sounds. The most important were
two forms of drums, the <i>huehuetl</i> and the <i>teponaztli</i>.</p>

<p>The word <i>huehuetl</i> means something old, something ancient, and
therefore important and great. The drum so-called was a hollow
cylinder of wood, thicker than a man's body, and usually about five
palms in height. The end was covered with tanned deerskin, firmly
stretched. The sides were often elaborately carved and tastefully
painted. This drum was placed upright on a stand in front of the
player and the notes were produced by striking the parchment with the
tips of the fingers.</p>

<p>A smaller variety of this instrument was called <i>tlapanhuehuetl</i>, or
the half drum, which was of the same diameter but only half the
height.<a name="fn27_r"></a><a href="#fn27"><sup><small>27</small></sup></a> Still another variety was the <i>yopihuehuetl</i>, "the drum
which tears out the heart,"<a name="fn28_r"></a><a href="#fn28"><sup><small>28</small></sup></a> so called either by reason of its
penetrating and powerful sound, or because it was employed at the
<i>Yopico</i>, where that form of human sacrifice was conducted.</p>

<p>The <i>teponaztli</i> was a cylindrical block of wood hollowed out below,
and on its upper surface with two longitudinal parallel grooves
running nearly from end to end, and a third in the centre at right
angles to these, something in the shape of the letter I. The two
tongues left between the grooves were struck with balls of rubber,
<i>ulli</i>, on the ends of handles or drum sticks. These instruments
varied greatly in size, some being five feet in length, and others so
small that they could conveniently be carried suspended to the neck.
The <i>teponaztli</i> was the house instrument of the Nahuas. It was
played in the women's apartments to amuse the noble ladies, and the
war captains carried one at the side to call the attention of their
cohorts on the field of battle (Sahagun). The word is derived from
the name of the tree whose wood was selected to make the drum, and
this in turn from the verb <i>tepunazoa</i>, to swell, probably from some
peculiarity of its growth.<a name="fn29_r"></a><a href="#fn29"><sup><small>29</small></sup></a></p>

<p>A much superior instrument to the teponaztli, and doubtless a
development from it, was the <i>tecomapiloa</i>, "the suspended vase"
(<i>tecomatl</i>, gourd or vase, <i>piloa</i>, to hang or suspend). It was a
solid block of wood, with a projecting ridge on its upper surface and
another opposite, on its lower aspect; to the latter one or more
gourds or vases were suspended, which increased and softened the
sound when the upper ridge was struck with the <i>ulli</i>.<a name="fn30_r"></a><a href="#fn30"><sup><small>30</small></sup></a> This was
undoubtedly the origin of the <i>marimba</i>, which I have described
elsewhere.<a name="fn31_r"></a><a href="#fn31"><sup><small>31</small></sup></a></p>

<p>The musical properties of these drums have been discussed by Theodor
Baker. The teponaztli, he states, could yield but two notes, and
could not have been played in accord with the huehuetl. It served as
an imperfect contra-bass.<a name="fn32_r"></a><a href="#fn32"><sup><small>32</small></sup></a></p>

<p>The <i>omichicahuaz</i>, "strong bone," was constructed somewhat on the
principle of a <i>teponaztli</i>. A large and long bone was selected, as
the femur of a man or deer, and it was channeled by deep longitudinal
incisions. The projections left between the fissures were rasped with
another bone or a shell, and thus a harsh but varied sound could be
produced.<a name="fn33_r"></a><a href="#fn33"><sup><small>33</small></sup></a></p>

<p>The <i>tetzilacatl</i>, the "vibrator" or "resounder," was a sheet of
copper suspended by a cord, which was struck with sticks or with the
hand. It appears to have been principally confined to the sacred
music in the temples.</p>

<p>The <i>ayacachtli</i> was a rattle formed of a jar of earthenware or a
dried gourd containing pebbles which was fastened to a handle, and
served to mark time in the songs and dances. An extension of this
simple instrument was the <i>ayacachicahualiztli</i>, "the arrangement of
rattles," which was a thin board about six feet long and a span wide,
to which were attached bells, rattles and cylindrical pieces of hard
wood. Shaking this produced a jingle-jangle, agreeable to the native
ear. The Aztec bells of copper, <i>tzilinilli</i>, are really metallic
rattles, like our sleigh bells. They are often seen in collections of
Mexican antiquities. Other names for them were <i>coyolli</i> and
<i>yoyotli</i>.</p>

<p>Various forms of flutes and fifes, made of reeds, of bone or of
pottery, were called by names derived from the word <i>pitzaua</i>, to
blow (e.g., <i>tlapitzalli</i>, <i>uilacapitzli</i>), and sometimes, as being
punctured with holes, <i>zozoloctli</i>, from <i>zotl</i>, the awl or
instrument used in perforating skins, etc. Many of those made of
earthenware have been preserved, and they appear to have been a
highly-esteemed instrument, as Sahagun mentions that the leader of
the choir of singers in the temple bore the title <i>tlapitzcatzin</i>,
"the noble flute player."</p>

<p>Large conches were obtained on the seashore and framed into wind
instruments called <i>quiquiztli</i> and <i>tecciztli</i>, whose hoarse notes
could be heard for long distances, and whistles of wood, bone and
earthenware added their shrill notes to the noise of the chanting of
the singers. The shell of the tortoise, <i>ayotl</i>, dried and suspended,
was beaten in unison with such instruments.</p>

<p>Recent researches by competent musical experts conducted upon
authentic specimens of the ancient Mexican instruments have tended to
elevate our opinion of their skill in this art. Mr. H.T. Cresson, of
the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, has critically
examined the various Aztec clay flutes, whistles, etc., which are
there preserved, and has reached the following conclusions:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I. That upon the four-holed clay flageolets the chromatic and
diatonic scales can be produced with a full octave.</p>

<p>"II. That the clay whistles or pitch pipes, which may be manipulated
in quartette, will produce an octave and a fourth.</p>

<p>"III. From the facts above shown, the Aztecs must have possessed a
knowledge of the scales as known to us, which has been fully tested
by comparison with the flute and organ."<a name="fn34_r"></a><a href="#fn34"><sup><small>34</small></sup></a></p>

<p>This result indicates for the instrumental accompaniment a much
higher position in musical notation than has hitherto been accepted.</p>

<a name="S_7"></a><h3>§ 7. <i>THE POETIC DIALECT.</i></h3>

<p>All the old writers who were familiar with the native songs speak of
their extreme obscurity, and the difficulty of translating them. No
one will question the intimate acquaintance with the Nahuatl language
possessed by Father Sahagun; yet no one has expressed more strongly
than he the vagueness of the Nahuatl poetic dialect. "Our enemy on
earth," he writes, "has prepared a thick woods and a dangerous ground
full of pitfalls, wherein to devise his evil deeds and to hide
himself from attack, as do wild beasts and venomous serpents. This
woods and these pitfalls are the songs which he has inspired to be
used in his service, as praises to his honor, in the temples and
elsewhere; because they are composed with such a trick that they
proclaim only what the devil commands, and are understood only by
those to whom they are addressed. It is well known that the cavern,
woods or depths in which the devil hides himself were these chants or
psalms which he himself has composed, and which cannot be understood
in their true significance except by those who are accustomed to the
peculiar style of their language."<a name="fn35_r"></a><a href="#fn35"><sup><small>35</small></sup></a></p>

<p>Not less positive are the expressions of Father Diego Duran,
contemporary of Sahagun, and himself well versed in the native
tongue. "All their songs," he observes, "were composed in such
obscure metaphors that scarcely any one can understand them unless he
give especial attention to their construction."<a name="fn36_r"></a><a href="#fn36"><sup><small>36</small></sup></a> The worthy
Boturini was puzzled by those which he had collected, and writes,
"the songs are difficult to explain, because they mystify historical
facts with constant allegorizing,"<a name="fn37_r"></a><a href="#fn37"><sup><small>37</small></sup></a> and Boturini's literary
executor, Don Mariano Echevarria y Veitia, who paid especial
attention to the poetic fragments he had received, says frankly: "The
fact is, that as to the songs I have not found a person who can fully
translate them, because there are many words in them whose
signification is absolutely unknown to-day, and moreover which do not
appear in the vocabularies of Molina or others."<a name="fn38_r"></a><a href="#fn38"><sup><small>38</small></sup></a></p>

<p>The Abbé Clavigero speaks in somewhat more definite terms of the
poetic forms and licenses of the language. He notes that in the
fragments of the ancient verses which had been preserved until his
day there were inserted between the significant words certain
interjections and meaningless syllables, apparently to fill out the
metre. Nevertheless, he considered the language of the chants, "pure,
pleasant, brilliant, figurative and replete with allusions to the
more pleasing objects in nature, as flowers, trees, brooks, etc."<a name="fn39_r"></a><a href="#fn39"><sup><small>39</small></sup></a>
It is quite evident from the above extracts that in the translation
of the ancient songs in the present volume we must be prepared for
serious difficulties, the more so as the Nahuatl language, in the
opinion of some who are the best acquainted with it, lends itself
with peculiar facility to ambiguities of expression and obscure
figures of speech.<a name="fn40_r"></a><a href="#fn40"><sup><small>40</small></sup></a> Students of American ethnology are familiar
with the fact that in nearly all tribes the language of the sacred
songs differs materially from that in daily life.</p>

<p>Of the older grammarians, Father Carochi alone has left us actual
specimens of the ancient poetic dialect, and his observations are
regretably brief. They occur in his chapter on the composition of
nouns and read as follows:<a name="fn41_r"></a><a href="#fn41"><sup><small>41</small></sup></a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"The ancient Indians were chary in forming compounds of more than two
words, while those of to-day exceed this number, especially if they
speak of sacred things; although in their poetic dialect the ancients
were also extravagant in this respect, as the following examples
show:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Tl&#257;uhquéch&#333;llaztal&#275;hualtò t&#333;natoc.</p>

<p>1. It is gleaming red like the tlauhquechol bird.</p>

<p>2. Ayauhcoçam&#257;l&#333;t&#333;nam&#275;yòtimani.</p>

<p>2. And it glows like the rainbow.</p>

<p>3. Xiuhcóyólizítzîlica in te&#333;cuitlahu&#275;hu&#275;tl.</p>

<p>3. The silver drum sounds like bells of turquoise.</p>

<p>4. Xiuhtlapallàcuil&#333;l&#257;moxtli manca.</p>

<p>4. There was a book of annals written and painted in colors.</p>

<p>5. Nic ch&#257;lchiuhcozcameca quenmach tòtóma in nocuic.</p>

<p>5. I see my song unfolding in a thousand directions, like a string of
precious stones."</p>

<p>From the specimens presented in this volume and from the above
extracts, I would assign the following peculiarities to the poetic
dialect of the Nahuatl:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. Extreme frequency and richness of metaphor. Birds, flowers,
precious stones and brilliant objects are constantly introduced in a
figurative sense, often to the point of obscuring the meaning of the
sentence.</p>

<p>II. Words are compounded to a much greater extent than in ordinary
prose writing.</p>

<p>III. Both words and grammatical forms unknown to the tongue of daily
life occur. These may be archaic, or manufactured capriciously by the
poet.</p>

<p>IV. Vowels are inordinately lengthened and syllables reduplicated,
either for the purpose of emphasis or of meter.</p>

<p>V. Meaningless interjections are inserted for metrical effect, while
others are thrown in and repeated in order to express emotion.</p>

<p>VI. The rhetorical figure known as aposiopesis, where a sentence is
left unfinished and in an interjectional condition, in consequence of
some emotion of the mind, is not rare and adds to the obscurity of
the wording.</p>

<a name="S_8"></a><h3>§ 8. <i>THE PRESERVATION OF THE ANCIENT SONGS.</i></h3>

<p>In a passage already quoted,<a name="fn42_r"></a><a href="#fn42"><sup><small>42</small></sup></a>
 Sahagun imparts the interesting
information that the more important songs were written down by the
Nahuas in their books, and from these taught to the youth in the
schools. A certain branch of the Mexican hieroglyphic writing was
largely phonetic, constructed on that method to which I have applied
the adjective <i>ikonomatic</i>, and by which it was quite possible to
preserve the sound as well as the sense of sentences and verses.<a name="fn43_r"></a><a href="#fn43"><sup><small>43</small></sup></a>
Such attention could have been bestowed only on the sacred, royal, or
legendary chants, while the compositions of ordinary poets would only
be disseminated by oral teaching.</p>

<p>By one or both of these methods there was a large body of poetic
chants the property of the Nahuatl-speaking tribes, when they were
subjugated by the Europeans. Among the intelligent missionaries who
devoted their lives to mastering the language and translating into it
the doctrines of Christianity, there were a few who felt sufficient
interest in these chants to write some of them down in the original
tongue. Conspicuous among these was the laborious Bernardino de
Sahagun, whose works are our most valued sources of information on
all that concerns the life of the ancient Nahuas. He collected a
number of their sacred hymns, translated them into Spanish, and
inserted them into the Appendix to the Second Book of his <i>History of
New Spain</i>; but this portion of his work was destroyed by order of
the Inquisition, as a note in the original MS. expressly states.<a name="fn44_r"></a><a href="#fn44"><sup><small>44</small></sup></a></p>

<p>A certain number, however, were preserved in the original tongue,
and, as already noted, we find the able grammarian Horatio Carochi,
who published his Grammar of the Nahuatl in 1645, quoting lines from
some as furnishing examples of the genuine ancient forms of
word-building. He could not, therefore, have doubted their antiquity
and authenticity.</p>

<p>A number of these must have come to the knowledge and were probably
in the possession of the eminent mathematician and antiquary Don
Carlos de Siguenza y Gongora, who lived in the latter half of the
same century (died 1700). It was avowedly upon the information which
he thought he gleaned from these ancient chants that he constructed
his historical theory of the missionary labors of St. Thomas in
Mexico in the first century of our era. The title of the work he
wrote upon this notion was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Fenix del Occidente San Thomas Apóstol, hallado con el nombre de
Quetzalcoatl entre las cenizas de antiguas tradiciones, conservadas
en piedras, en Teoamoxtles Tultecas, y en cantares Teochichimecas y
Mexicanos."</i></p>

<p>For many years this curious work, which was never printed, was
supposed to be lost; but the original MS. is extant, in the
possession of the distinguished antiquary Don Alfredo Chavero, of the
City of Mexico.<a name="fn45_r"></a><a href="#fn45"><sup><small>45</small></sup></a> Unfortunately, however, the author did not insert
in his work any song in the native language nor a literal translation
of any, as I am informed by Señor Chavero, who has kindly examined
the work carefully at my request, with this inquiry in view.</p>

<p>Half a century later, when Boturini was collecting his material, he
found but very few of the old poems. In the catalogue of his MSS. he
mentions (XIX, 1) some fragments of ancient songs, badly written, on
European paper, but he does not say whether in the original or
translated. The same doubt might rest on the two songs of
Nezahualcoyotl named in his Catalogue (V, 2). He does not
specifically state that they are in the original. The song of
Moquihuix, King of Tlatilulco, in which he celebrated his victory
over the Cuextla, which Boturini states in his text (p. 91) as in his
possession, is not mentioned at all in his Catalogue, and it is
uncertain whether his copy was in Nahuatl.</p>

<p>His literary friend, however, Don Mariano Echevarria y Veitia,
removes the uncertainty about the two songs of Nezahualcoyotl, as he
informs us that they were in the original tongue, and adds that he
had inserted them in his History without translation.<a name="fn46_r"></a><a href="#fn46"><sup><small>46</small></sup></a> I have
examined the manuscript of his work, now in the Lenox Library, New
York City, but it does not contain these texts, and evidently the
copy used by Bustamente did not.<a name="fn47_r"></a><a href="#fn47"><sup><small>47</small></sup></a></p>

<p>Boturini included the translations of the two odes of Nezahualcoyotl
in a work on the Virgin of Guadelupe, only a fragment of which has
been preserved. One of the chapters in this Latin Essay is entitled
<i>De Indorum Poetarum Canticis sive Prosodiis</i>, in which he introduces
Ixtlilxochitl's translation and also a song in the original Nahuatl,
but the latter is doubtless of late date and unimportant as a really
native production.<a name="fn48_r"></a><a href="#fn48"><sup><small>48</small></sup></a></p>

<p>The fragments of Boturini's library collected by M. Aubin, of Paris,
contain a number of the original ancient songs of the highest
importance, which make us regret the more that this collection has
been up to the present inaccessible to students. In his description
of these relics published in 1851, M. Aubin refers to the <i>Historical
Annals of the Mexican Nation</i> (§ VIII, 10, of Boturini's Catalogue)
as containing "historical songs in a dialect so difficult that I have
not been able to translate them entirely," and adds that similar
songs are preserved in others of the ancient annals in his hands.<a name="fn49_r"></a><a href="#fn49"><sup><small>49</small></sup></a></p>

<a name="S_9"></a><h3>§ 9. <i>THE LX SONGS OF THE KING NEZAHUALCOYOTL.</i></h3>

<p>The most distinguished figure among the Nahuatl poets was
Nezahualcoyotl, ruler of Tezcuco. His death took place in 1472, at
the age of eighty years. His father, Ixtlilxochitl, had been deprived
of his possessions and put to death by Tezozomoc, King of the
Tepanecas, and until the death of the latter at an advanced age in
1427, Nezahualcoyotl could make but vain efforts to restore the power
of his family. Much of the time he was in extreme want, and for this
reason, and for his savage persistence in the struggle, he acquired
the name "the fasting or hungry wolf"&mdash; <i>nezahualcoyotl</i>. Another of
his names was <i>Acolmiztli</i>, usually translated "arm of the lion,"
from <i>aculli</i>, shoulder, and <i>miztli</i>, lion.</p>

<p>A third was <i>Yoyontzin</i>, which is equivalent to <i>cevetor nobilis</i>,
from <i>yoyoma</i> (<i>cevere</i>, i.e., <i>femora movere in re venered</i>); it is
to be understood figuratively as indicating the height of the
masculine forces.</p>

<p>When his power became assured, he proved himself a liberal and
enlightened patron of the arts and industries. The poetry and music
of his native land attracted him the more as he felt within himself
the moving god, firing his imagination with poetic vision, the <i>Deus
in nobis, calescimus, agitant'illo</i>. Not only did he diligently seek
out and royally entertain skilled bards, but he himself had the
credit of composing sixty chants, and it appears that after the
Conquest there were that many written down in Roman characters and
attributed to him. We need not inquire too closely whether they were
strictly his own composition. Perhaps they were framed on themes
which he furnished, or were selected by him from those sung at his
court by various bards. The history of the works by royal authors
everywhere must not be too minutely scanned if we wish to leave them
their reputation for originality.</p>

<p>He was of a philosophic as well as a poetic temperament, and
reflected deeply on the problems of life and nature. Following the
inherent tendency of the enlightened intellect to seek unity in
diversity, the One in the Many, he reached the conclusion to which so
many thinkers in all ages and of all races have been driven, that
underlying all phenomena is one primal and adequate Cause, the
Essence of all Existence. This conclusion he expressed in a
philosophic apothegm which was preserved by his disciples, in these
words:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ipan in chicunauitlamanpan meztica in tloque nahuaque palne nohuani
teyocoyani icel teotl oquiyocox in ixquex quexquex in ittoni ihuan
amo ittoni.</i></p>

<p>"In the ninth series is the Cause of All, of us and of all created
things, the one only God who created all things both visible and
invisible."<a name="fn50_r"></a><a href="#fn50"><sup><small>50</small></sup></a></p>

<p>To perpetuate the memory of this philosophic deduction he caused to
be constructed at Tezcuco a stone tower nine stories in height, the
ruins of which were visible long after the Spanish occupation. To
this tower he gave the name Chililitli, a term of uncertain meaning,
but which we find was applied in Tenochtitlan to a building sacred to
the Nine Winds.<a name="fn51_r"></a><a href="#fn51"><sup><small>51</small></sup></a> To explain the introduction of this number, I
should add that a certain school of Nahuatl priests taught that the
heaven above and the earth below were each divided into nine
concentric arcs, each leading farther and farther away from the
conditions of the present life. Hence, there were nine heavens,
abodes of the gods, and nine lower regions, abodes of the souls of
the dead. Another school taught that there were not nine but thirteen
of these stages.</p>

<p>The sixty poems by Nezahualcoyotl are mentioned by various writers as
in existence after the Conquest, reduced to writing in the original
tongue, and of several of them we have translations or abstracts.<a name="fn52_r"></a><a href="#fn52"><sup><small>52</small></sup></a>
Of four the translations claim to be complete, and were published
entire for the first time in the original Spanish by Lord
Kingsborough in the ninth volume of his great work on the
<i>Antiquities of Mexico</i>. Since then they have received various
renderings in prose and verse into different languages at the hands
of modern writers.</p>

<p>I shall give a literal prose translation from the Spanish, numbering
the poems and their verses, for convenience of reference, in the
order in which they appear in the pages of Lord Kingsborough.</p>

<hr style="width: 50%;">

<p>The first is one referred to, and partly translated by Ixtlilxochitl,
in his <i>Historia Chichimeca</i> (cap. 47). He calls it a <i>xopancuicatl</i>
(see ante, p. 15), and states that it was composed and sung on the
occasion of the banquet when the king laid the foundations of his
great palace. He gives the first words in the original as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tlaxoconcaguican ani Nezahualcoyotzin;</i></p>

<p>And the translation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hear that which says the King Nezahualcoyotl."</p>

<p>Restoring the much mutilated original to what I should think was its
proper form, the translation should read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Listen attentively to what I, the singer, the noble Nezahualcoyotl,
say:"&mdash;</p>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p>1. Listen with attention to the lamentations which I, the King
Nezahualcoyotl, make upon my power, speaking with myself, and
offering an example to others.</p>

<p>2. O restless and striving king, when the time of thy death shall
come, thy subjects shall be destroyed and driven forth; they shall
sink into dark oblivion. Then in thy hand shall no longer be the
power and the rule, but with the Creator, the All-powerful.</p>

<p>3. He who saw the palaces and court of the old King Tezozomoc, how
flourishing and powerful was his sway, may see them now dry and
withered; it seemed as if they should last forever, but all that the
world offers is illusion and deception, as everything must end and
die.</p>

<p>4. Sad and strange it is to see and reflect on the prosperity and
power of the old and dying King Tezozomoc; watered with ambition and
avarice, he grew like a willow tree rising above the grass and
flowers of spring, rejoicing for a long time, until at length,
withered and decayed, the storm wind of death tore him from his
roots, and dashed him in fragments to the ground. The same fate
befell the ancient King Colzatzli, so that no memory was left of him,
nor of his lineage.</p>

<p>5. In these lamentations and in this sad song, I now call to memory
and offer as an example that which takes place in the spring, and the
end which overtook King Tezozomoc; and who, seeing this, can refrain
from tears and wailing, that these various flowers and rich delights
are bouquets that pass from hand to hand and all wither and end even
in the present life!</p>

<p>6. Ye sons of kings and mighty lords, ponder well and think upon that
which I tell you in these my lamentations, of what takes place in
spring and of the end which overtook King Tezozomoc; and who, seeing
this, can refrain from tears and wailing that these various flowers
and rich delights are bouquets that pass from hand to hand and all
wither and end even in the present life!</p>

<p>7. Let the birds now enjoy, with melodious voices, the abundance of
the house of the flowery spring, and the butterflies sip the nectar
of its flowers.</p>

<hr style="width: 50%;">

<p>The second song is preserved in a Spanish metrical translation only,
but which from internal evidence I should judge to be quite literal.
The words of the poem do not represent it as a composition by the
royal poet, but one which was sung before him, and addressed to him.
It admonishes him to rejoice in the present moment, as the
uncertainties of life and fate must at some time, perhaps very soon,
deprive him of their enjoyment.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p>1. I wish to sing for a moment, since time and occasion are
propitious; I hope to be permitted, as my intention merits it, and I
begin my song, though it were better called a lamentation.</p>

<p>2. And thou, beloved companion, enjoy the beauty of these flowers,
rejoice with me, cast out fears, for if pleasure ends with life, so
also does pain.</p>

<p>3. I, singing, will touch the sonorous instrument, and thou,
rejoicing in the flowers, dance and give pleasure to God the
powerful. Let us be happy in the present, for life is transitory.</p>

<p>4. Thou hast placed thy noble court in Acolhuacan, thine are its
lintels, thou hast decked them, and one may well believe that with
such grandeur thy state shall increase and grow.</p>

<p>5. O prudent Yoyontzin, famous king and peerless monarch, rejoice in
the present, be happy in the springtime, for a day shall come in
which thou shall vainly seek these joys.</p>

<p>6. Then thy destiny shall snatch the sceptre from thy hand, thy moon
shall wane, no longer wilt thou be strong and proud, then thy
servants shall be destitute of all things.</p>

<p>7. In this sad event, the nobles of thy line, the provinces of might,
children of noble parents, lacking thee as their lord, shall taste
the bitterness of poverty.</p>

<p>8. They shall call to mind how great was thy pomp, thy triumphs and
victories, and bewailing the glory and majesty of the past, their
tears will flow like seas.</p>

<p>9. These thy descendants who serve thy plume and crown, when thou art
gone, will forsake Culhuacan, and as exiles will increase their woes.</p>

<p>10. Little will fame have to tell of this wondrous majesty, worthy of
a thousand heralds; the nations will only remember how wisely
governed the three chieftains who held the power,</p>

<p>11. At Mexico, Montezuma the famous and valorous, at Culhuacan the
fortunate Nezahualcoyotl, and at the stronghold of Acatlapan,
Totoquilhuatli.</p>

<p>12. I fear no oblivion for thy just deeds, standing as thou dost in
thy place appointed by the Supreme Lord of All, who governs all
things.</p>

<p>13. Therefore, O Nezahualcoyotl, rejoice in what the present offers,
crown thyself with flowers from thy gardens, hear my song and music
which aim to please thee.</p>

<p>14. The pleasures and riches of this life are but loaned, their
substance is vain, their appearance illusory; and so true is this
that I ask thee for an answer to these questions:</p>

<p>15. What has become of Cihuapan? Of the brave Quantzintecomatzin? Of
Conahuatzin? What of all these people? Perhaps these very words have
already passed into another life.</p>

<p>16. Would that we who are now united by the ties of love and
friendship could foresee the sharp edge of death, for nothing is
certain, and the future ever brings changes.</p>

<hr style="width: 50%;">

<p>The third is a "spring song" in which the distinguished warriors of
the king are compared to precious stones. Such jewels were believed
by the Nahuas to possess certain mysterious powers as charms and
amulets, a belief, it is needless to say, found among almost all
nations. In verse 18 there is a reference to the superstition that at
dawn, when these jewels are exposed to the first rays of the sun,
they emit a fine vapor which wafts abroad their subtle potency. The
poem is in Spanish verse, and the original is said to have been
written down by Don Fernando de Avila, governor of Tlalmanalco, from
the mouth of Don Juan de Aguilar, governor of Cultepec, a direct
descendant of Nezahualcoyotl.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>1. The flowery spring has its house, its court, its palace, adorned
with riches, with goods in abundance.</p>

<p>2. With discreet art they are arranged and placed, rich feathers,
precious stones, surpassing in luster the sun.</p>

<p>3. There is the valued carbuncle, which from its beauteous center
darts forth rays which are the lights of knowledge.</p>

<p>4. There is the prized diamond, sign of strength, shooting forth its
brilliant gleams.</p>

<p>5. Here one sees the translucent emerald suggesting the hope of the
rewards of merit.</p>

<p>6. Next follows the topaz, equaling the emerald, for the reward it
promises is a heavenly dwelling.</p>

<p>7. The amethyst, signifying the cares which a king has for his
subjects, and moderation in desires.</p>

<p>8. These are what kings, princes and monarchs delight to place upon
their breasts and crowns.</p>

<p>9. All these stones with their varied and singular virtues, adorn Thy
house and court, O Father, O Infinite God!</p>

<p>10. These stones which I the King Nezahualcoyotl have succeeded in
uniting in loving liens,</p>

<p>11. Are the famous princes, the one called Axaxacatzin, the other
Chimalpopoca, and Xicomatzintlamata.</p>

<p>12. To-day, somewhat rejoiced by the joy and words of these, and of
the other lords who were with them,</p>

<p>13. I feel, when alone, that my soul is pleased but for a brief time,
and that all pleasure soon passes.</p>

<p>14. The presence of these daring eagles pleases me, of these lions
and tigers who affright the world,</p>

<p>15. These who by their valor win everlasting renown, whose name and
whose deeds fame will perpetuate.</p>

<p>16. Only to-day am I glad and look upon these rich and varied stones,
the glory of my bloody battles.</p>

<p>17. To-day, noble princes, protectors of the realm, my will is to
entertain you and to praise you.</p>

<p>18. It seems to me that ye answer from your souls, like the fine
vapor arising from precious stones,&mdash;</p>

<p>19. "O King Nezahualcoyotl, O royal Montezuma, your subjects sustain
themselves with your soft dews.</p>

<p>20. "But at last a day shall come which will cut away this power, and
all these will be left wretched orphans.</p>

<p>21. "Rejoice, mighty King, in this lofty power which the King of
Heaven has granted you, rejoice and be glad.</p>

<p>22. "In the life of this world there is no beginning anew, therefore
rejoice, for all good ends.</p>

<p>23. "The future promises endless changes, griefs that your subjects
will have to undergo.</p>

<p>24. "Ye see before you the instruments decked with wreaths of odorous
flowers; rejoice in their fragrance.</p>

<p>25. "To-day there are peace, and goodfellowship; therefore let all
join hands and rejoice in the dances,</p>

<p>26. "So that for a little while princes and kings and the nobles may
have pleasure in these precious stones,</p>

<p>27. "Which through his goodness the will of the King Nezahualcoyotl
has set forth for you, inviting you to-day to his house."</p>

<hr style="width: 50%;">

<p>The fourth song has been preserved in an Otomi translation by the
Mexican antiquary Granados y Galvez<a name="fn53_r"></a><a href="#fn53"><sup><small>53</small></sup></a> and in an abstract by
Torquemada.<a name="fn54_r"></a><a href="#fn54"><sup><small>54</small></sup></a> The latter gives the first words as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Xochitl mamani in huehuetitlan:</i></p>

<p>Which he translates:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There are fresh and fragrant flowers among the groves."</p>

<p>It is said to have been composed at the time the king dedicated his
palace.</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>1. The fleeting pomps of the world are like the green willow trees,
which, aspiring to permanence, are consumed by a fire, fall before
the axe, are upturned by the wind, or are scarred and saddened by
age.</p>

<p>2. The grandeurs of life are like the flowers in color and in fate;
the beauty of these remains so long as their chaste buds gather and
store the rich pearls of the dawn and saving it, drop it in liquid
dew; but scarcely has the Cause of All directed upon them the full
rays of the sun, when their beauty and glory fail, and the brilliant
gay colors which decked forth their pride wither and fade.</p>

<p>3. The delicious realms of flowers count their dynasties by short
periods; those which in the morning revel proudly in beauty and
strength, by evening weep for the sad destruction of their thrones,
and for the mishaps which drive them to loss, to poverty, to death
and to the grave. All things of earth have an end, and in the midst
of the most joyous lives, the breath falters, they fall, they sink
into the ground.</p>

<p>4. All the earth is a grave, and nought escapes it; nothing is so
perfect that it does not fall and disappear. The rivers, brooks,
fountains and waters flow on, and never return to their joyous
beginnings; they hasten on to the vast realms of Tlaloc, and the
wider they spread between their marges the more rapidly do they mould
their own sepulchral urns. That which was yesterday is not to-day;
and let not that which is to-day trust to live to-morrow.</p>

<p>5. The caverns of earth are filled with pestilential dust which once
was the bones, the flesh, the bodies of great ones who sate upon
thrones, deciding causes, ruling assemblies, governing armies,
conquering provinces, possessing treasures, tearing down temples,
flattering themselves with pride, majesty, fortune, praise and
dominion. These glories have passed like the dark smoke thrown out by
the fires of Popocatepetl, leaving no monuments but the rude skins on
which they are written.</p>

<p>6. Ha! ha! Were I to introduce you into the obscure bowels of this
temple, and were to ask you which of these bones were those of the
powerful Achalchiuhtlanextin, first chief of the ancient Toltecs; of
Necaxecmitl, devout worshiper of the gods; if I inquire where is the
peerless beauty of the glorious empress Xiuhtzal, where the peaceable
Topiltzin, last monarch of the hapless land of Tulan; if I ask you
where are the sacred ashes of our first father Xolotl; those of the
bounteous Nopal; those of the generous Tlotzin; or even the still
warm cinders of my glorious and immortal, though unhappy and luckless
father Ixtlilxochitl; if I continued thus questioning about all our
august ancestors, what would you reply? The same that I reply&mdash;I know
not, I know not; for first and last are confounded in the common
clay. What was their fate shall be ours, and of all who follow us.</p>

<p>7. Unconquered princes, warlike chieftains, let us seek, let us sigh
for the heaven, for there all is eternal, and nothing is corruptible.
The darkness of the sepulchre is but the strengthening couch for the
glorious sun, and the obscurity of the night but serves to reveal the
brilliancy of the stars. No one has power to alter these heavenly
lights, for they serve to display the greatness of their Creator, and
as our eyes see them now, so saw them our earliest ancestors, and so
shall see them our latest posterity.</p>

<hr style="width: 50%;">

<p>It will be seen that the philosophy of these songs is mostly of the
Epicurean and <i>carpe diem</i> order. The certainty of death and the
mutability of fortune, observations which press themselves upon the
mind of man everywhere, are their principal staples, and cast over
them a hue of melancholy, relieved by exhortations to enjoy to the
utmost what the present moment offers of pleasure and sensual
gratification. Here and there a gleam of a higher philosophy lights
the sombre reflections of the bard; his thoughts turn toward the
infinite Creator of this universe, and he dimly apprehends that by
making Him the subject of his contemplation, there is boundless
consolation even in this mortal life.</p>

<p>Both these leading <i>motifs</i> recur over and over again in the songs
printed in the original in the present volume, and this similarity is
a common token of the authenticity of the book.</p>

<a name="S_10"></a><h3>§ 10. <i>THE HISTORY OF THE PRESENT COLLECTION.</i></h3>
<p>The most recent Mexican writers formally deny that any ancient
Mexican poetry is now extant. Thus the eminent antiquary, Don Alfredo
Chavero, in his elaborate work, <i>México á través de los Siglos</i>,
says, "the truth is, we know no specimens of the ancient poetry, and
those, whether manuscript or printed, which claim to be such, date
from after the Conquest."<a name="fn55_r"></a><a href="#fn55"><sup><small>55</small></sup></a> In a similar strain the grammarian
Diario Julio Caballero, writes: "There has never come into our hands
a single poetic composition in this language. It is said that the
great King Nezahualcoyotl was a poet and composed various songs;
however that may be, the fact is that we have never seen any such
compositions, nor met any person who has seen them."<a name="fn56_r"></a><a href="#fn56"><sup><small>56</small></sup></a></p>

<p>It is important, therefore, to state the exact provenance of the
specimens printed in this volume, many of which I consider to have
been composed previous to the Conquest, and written down shortly
after the Nahuatl language had been reduced to the Spanish alphabet.</p>

<p>All of them are from a MS. volume in the library of the University of
Mexico, entitled <i>Cantares de los Mexicanos y otros opusculos</i>,
composed of various pieces in different handwritings, which, from
their appearance and the character of the letter, were attributed by
the eminent antiquary Don José F. Ramirez, to the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries.</p>

<p>The copy I have used is that made by the late Abbé Brasseur (de
Bourbourg). It does not appear to be complete, but my efforts to have
it collated with the original have not been successful. Another copy
was taken by the late well-known Mexican scholar Faustino
Chimalpopoca, which was in the possession of Señor Ramirez and sold
at the vendue of his books in 1880. It is No. 511 of the catalogue.</p>

<p>The final decision of the age of the poems must come from a careful
scrutiny of the internal evidence, especially the thoughts they
contain and the language in which they are expressed. In applying
these tests, it should be remembered that a song may be almost wholly
ancient, that is, composed anterior to the Conquest, and yet display
a few later allusions introduced by the person who preserved it in
writing, so as to remove from it the flavor of heathenism. Some
probable instances of this kind will be pointed out in the Notes.</p>

<p>The songs are evidently from different sources and of different
epochs. There are two notes inserted in the MS. which throw some
light on the origin of a few of the poems. The first is in connection
with No. XII. In my copy of the MS, the title of this song is written
twice, and between the two the following memorandum appears in
Spanish:</p>

<p>"Ancient songs of the native Otomis, which they were accustomed to
sing at their festivals and marriages, translated into the Mexican
language, the play and the spirit of the song and its figures of
speech being always retained; as Your Reverence will understand, they
displayed considerable style and beauty, better than I can express
with my slight talent; and may Your Reverence at your convenience
approve and be entertained by them, as a skilled master of the
tongue, as Your Reverence is."</p>

<p>From its position and from the titles following, this note appears to
apply only to No. XII.</p>

<p>The second note is prefixed to No. XIV, which has no title. It is in
Nahuatl, and reads as follows:&mdash;</p>

<hr style="width: 50%;">

<hr style="width: 50%;">

<p>This may be freely translated as follows:&mdash;</p>

<hr style="width: 50%;">

<p>"Here begins a song called a plain song of Huexotzinco as it was
recited by the lords of Huexotzinco. These songs are divided into
three classes, the songs of the nobles or of the eagles, the flower
songs, and the songs of destitution. (Directions follow for beating
the drum in unison with the voices.) This song was sung at the house
of Don Diego de Leon, Governor of Azcapotzalco; he who beat the drum
was Don Francisco Placido; in the year of the resurrection of our
Lord Jesus Christ 1551."</p>

<hr style="width: 50%;">

<p>This assigns beyond doubt the song in question to the first half of
the sixteenth century, and we may therefore take its phraseology as a
type of the Nahuatl poetry shortly after the Conquest. It is also
stated to be a native composition, and from its contents, it was
clearly composed by one of the converts to the Christian faith.</p>

<a name="NOTES_I"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG I.</h3>

<p>The song is an allegory, portraying the soul-life of the poet. By the
flowers which he sets forth to seek, we are to understand the songs
which he desires to compose. He asks himself where the poetic
inspiration is to be sought, and the answer is the same as was given
by Wordsworth, that it is to the grand and beautiful scenes of Nature
that the poet must turn for the elevation of soul which will lift him
to the sublimest heights of his art. But this exaltation bears with
it the heavy penalty that it disqualifies for ordinary joys. As in
medieval tales, he who had once been admitted to fairyland, could
nevermore conquer his longing to return thither, so the poet longs
for some other condition of existence where the divine spirit of song
may forever lift him above the trials and the littleness of this
earthly life.</p>

<p>There is no sign of Christian influence in the poem, and it is
probably one handed down from a generation anterior to the Conquest.</p>

<p>1. The word <i>peuhcayotl</i> from <i>peua</i>, to begin, intimates that this
was a song chanted at the beginning of a musical entertainment. The
verses are longer, and the phraseology plainer than in many of those
following. There is also an absence of interjections and lengthened
vowels, all of which indicate that the time was slow, and the actions
of the singer temperate, as was the custom at the beginning of a
<i>baile</i>. (See Introd., p. 20.)</p>

<p>1. <i>Ninoyolnonotza</i>, a reflexive, frequentative form from <i>notza</i>, to
think, to reflect, itself from the primitive radicle <i>no</i>, mind,
common to both the Nahuatl and Maya languages. The syllable <i>yol</i> is
for <i>yollotl</i>, heart, in its figurative sense of soul or mind. The
combination of <i>yolnonotza</i> is not found in any of the dictionaries.
The full sense is, "I am thinking by myself, in my heart."</p>

<p><i>ahuiaca</i>, an adverbial form, usually means "pleasant-smelling,"
though in derivation it is from the verb <i>ahuia</i>, to be satisfied
with.</p>

<p><i>quetzal</i>, for <i>quetzalli</i>, a long, handsome blue feather from the
quetzal bird, often used figuratively for anything beautiful or
precious.</p>

<p><i>chalchiuh</i> for <i>chalchiuitl</i>, the famous green-stone, jade or
emerald, so highly prized by the Mexicans; often used figuratively
for anything noble, beautiful and esteemed.</p>

<p><i>huitzitzicatin</i>, a word not found in the dictionaries, appears to be
from <i>tzitzilca</i>, to tremble, usually from cold, but here applied to
the tremulous motion of the humming bird as it hovers over a flower.</p>

<p><i>zacuan</i>, the yellow plumage of the zacuan bird, and from similarity
of color here applied to the butterfly. The zacuan is known to
ornithologists as the <i>Oriolus dominicensis</i>. These birds are
remarkably gregarious, sometimes as many as a hundred nests being
found in one tree (see Eduard Mühlenpfort, <i>Versuch einer getreuen
Schilderung der Republik Mexiko</i>, Bd. I, p. 183).</p>

<p><i>acxoyatzinitzcanquauhtla</i>; composed of <i>acxoyatl</i>, the wild laurel;
<i>tzinitzcan</i>, the native name of the <i>Trogon mexicanus</i>, renowned for
its beautiful plumage; <i>quauhtli</i>, a tree; and the place-ending
<i>tla</i>, meaning abundance.</p>

<p><i>tlauquecholxochiquauhtla</i>; composed of <i>tlauquechol</i>, the native
name of the red, spoon-billed heron, <i>Platalea ajaja; xochitl</i>,
flower; <i>quauhtli</i>, tree; and the place-ending <i>tla</i>.</p>

<p><i>tonameyotoc</i>, the root is the verb <i>tona</i>, to shine, to be warm;
<i>tonatiuh</i>, the sun; <i>tonameyotl</i>, a ray of the sun, etc. As warmth
and sunlight are the conditions of growth and fertility, many
derivatives from this root signify abundance, riches, etc.</p>

<p><i>mocehcemelquixtia</i>; <i>mo</i> is the reflexive pronoun, 3d sing., often
used impersonally; <i>cehcemel</i>, is a reduplicated form of the numeral
<i>ce</i>, one; it conveys the sense of entire, whole, perfect, and is
thus an interesting illustration of the tendency of the untutored
mind to associate the idea of unity with the notion of perfection;
<i>quixtia</i> is the compulsive form of <i>quiza</i>, to go forth.</p>

<p><i>onechittitique</i>; 3d person plural, preterit, of the causative form
of <i>itta</i>, to see; <i>ittitia</i>, to cause to see, to show; <i>nech</i>, me,
accusative form of the pronoun.</p>

<p><i>nocuexanco</i>; from <i>cuexantli</i>, the loose gown worn by the natives,
extending from the waist to the knees. Articles were carried in it as
in an apron; <i>no-cuexan-co</i>, my-gown-in, the terminal <i>tli</i> being
dropped on suffixing the postposition.</p>

<p><i>tepilhuan</i>; from <i>pilli</i>, boy, girl, child, young person, with the
relative, indefinite, pronominal prefix <i>te</i>, and the pronominal
plural termination <i>huan</i>, to take which, <i>pilli</i> drops its last
syllable, <i>li</i>; hence, <i>te-pil-huan</i>, somebody's children, or in
general, the young people. This word is of constant occurrence in the
songs.</p>

<p><i>teteuctin</i>, plural with reduplication of <i>teuctli</i>, a noble, a
ruler, a lord. The singer addresses his audience by this respectful
title.</p>

<p>2. <i>ixochicuicatzini</i>; <i>i</i>, poss. pron. 3d sing.; <i>xochitl</i>, flower;
<i>cuicatl</i>, song; <i>tzin</i>, termination signifying reverence or
affection; "their dear flower-songs."</p>

<p><i>yuhqui tepetl</i>, etc. The echo in the Nahuatl tongue is called
<i>tepeyolotl</i>, the heart or soul of the mountain (not in Simeon's
<i>Dictionnaire</i>, but given by Tezozomoc, <i>Cronica Mexicana</i>, p. 202).</p>

<p><i>meyaquetzalatl</i>; from <i>meya</i>, to flow slowly, to trickle;
<i>quetzalli</i>, beautiful; <i>atl</i>, water.</p>

<p><i>xiuhtotoameyalli</i>; the root <i>xiuh</i> meant originally green (or blue,
as they were not distinguished apart); hence <i>xiuitl</i>, a leaf or
plant, the green herbage; as where the Nahuas then were this was
renewed annually, <i>xiuitl</i> came to mean a year; as a comet seems to
have a bunch of fiery flames growing from it, this too was <i>xiuitl</i>,
and a turquoise was called by the same term; in the present compound,
it is employed adjectively; <i>xiuh-totol</i>, turquoise-bird, is the
<i>Guiaca cerulea</i>, Linn.; <i>ameyalli</i>, from <i>atl</i>, water, <i>meya</i>, to
trickle, and the noun ending.</p>

<p><i>mo-motla</i>; to throw one's self, to dash one's self against
something, etc.</p>

<p><i>centzontlatolli</i>; literally," four hundred speeches." The numeral
four hundred was employed, like the Greek "myriad," to express
vaguely any extraordinary number. The term may be rendered "the
myriad-voiced," and was the common name of the mocking-bird, called
by ornithologists <i>Turdus polyglottus</i>, <i>Calandria polyglotta</i>, and
<i>Mimus polyglotta</i>.</p>

<p><i>coyoltototl</i>, literally, "the rattle-bird," so called from its
peculiar notes (<i>coyolli</i> = a rattle), is one of the <i>Tanegridae</i>,
probably the <i>Piranga hepatica</i>.</p>

<p><i>ayacachicahuactimani</i>; composed of <i>ayacachtli</i>, the rattle (see
<i>ante</i>, page 24); and <i>icahuaca</i>, to sing (of birds); to the theme of
this verb is added the connective syllable <i>ti</i>, and the verb <i>mani</i>,
which, in such connection, indicates that the action of the former
verb is expended over a large surface, broadly and widely (see Olmos,
<i>Gram. de la Langue Nahuatl</i>, p. 155, where, however, the connective
<i>ti</i> is erroneously taken for the pronoun <i>ti</i>).</p>

<p><i>hueltetozcatemique</i>; composed of <i>huel</i>, good or well; <i>tetozca</i>,
from <i>tozquitl</i>, the singing voice; and <i>temo</i>, to let fall, to drop;
<i>que</i> is the plural verbal termination.</p>

<p>3. <i>ma n-amech-ellelti</i>, vetative causative from <i>elleloa</i>, to cause
pain.</p>

<p><i>cactimotlalique</i>, appears to be a compound of <i>caqui</i>, to listen, to
hear, and <i>tlalia</i>, to seat, to place.</p>

<p><i>amohuampotzitzinhuan</i>, a compound based on the pronoun of the second
person plural, <i>amo</i>, the particle <i>po</i>, which means similarity or
likeness, and the reduplicated reverential plural termination. The
same particle <i>po</i>, appears a few lines later in <i>toquichpohuan</i>;
<i>potli</i> = comrade, compeer.</p>

<p>4. <i>Tepeitic</i>, from <i>tepetl</i>, mountain, <i>ititl</i>, belly, from which is
derived the proposition <i>itic</i>, within, among. The term is applied to
a ravine or sequestered valley.</p>

<p>5. <i>quauhtliya ocelotl</i>, the expression <i>quauhtli, ocelotl</i>, is of
frequent occurrence in the ancient Nahuatl writers. The words mean
literally "eagle, tiger." These were military titles applied to
officers commanding small bodies of troops; figuratively, the words
mean control, power, and dignity; also, bravery and virtue. Comp.
Agustin de Vetancurt, <i>Teatro Mexicano</i>, Tratado II, cap. 3.</p>

<p>6. <i>in tloque in nahuaque</i>; this expression, applied by the ancient
Nahuas to the highest divinity, is attributed by some to
Nezahualcoyotl (see above, p. 36). It is composed of two
postpositions <i>tloc</i> and <i>nahaac</i>, and in the form given conveys the
meaning "to whom are present and in whom are immanent all things
having life." See Agustin de la Rosa, <i>Analisis de la Platica
Mexicana sobre el Mislerio de la Santisima Trinidad</i>, p. 11
(Guadalajara, 1871). The epithet was applied in heathen times to the
supreme divinity Tonacateotl; see the <i>Codex Telleriano-Remensis</i>, in
Kingsborough's <i>Mexico</i>, Vol. VI, p. 107.</p>

<p>8. <i>ximoayan</i>; this word does not appear in the dictionaries of
Molina or Simeon, and is a proof, as is the sentiment of the whole
verse, that the present poem belongs to a period previous to the
Conquest. The term means "where all go to stay," and was the name of
the principal realm of departed souls in the mythology of the ancient
Nahuas. See Bartholome de Alva, <i>Confessionario en Lengua Mexicana</i>,
fol. 13 (Mexico, 1634); Tezozomoc, <i>Cronica Mexicana</i>, cap. 55; D.G.
Brinton; <i>The Journey of the Soul</i> (in Aztec and Aryan Myths),
Philadelphia, 1883.</p>

<p><i>yhuintia</i>, causative form of <i>ihuinti</i>, to make drunk. The Nirvana
of the Nahuas was for the soul to lie in dense smoke and darkness,
filled with utter content, and free from all impressions ("en lo
profundo de contento y obscuridad," Tezozomoc, <i>Cronica Mexicana</i>,
cap. 55).</p>

<a name="NOTES_II"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG II.</h3>

<p>On the signification of the titles given to this poem see the
Introduction, § 3.</p>

<p>1. <i>yehnan Dios</i>; literally "who are God;" the introduction of the
Spanish <i>Dios</i>, God, is in explanation of <i>in tloque in nahuaque</i>; so
far from proving that this song is of late date, this vouches for its
genuine ancient character, through the necessity for such
explanation.</p>

<p>2. <i>nelhuayotl</i>, the essence or source of something, its true nature;
probably from <i>nelli</i>, true.</p>

<p><i>teoquecholme</i>; the prefix <i>teotl</i>, divine, is often added as an
expression of admiration. Sahagun mentions the <i>teoquechol</i> as a bird
of brilliant plumage.</p>

<a name="NOTES_III"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG III.</h3>

<p>The poet recalls a recent attendance on the obsequies of an
acquaintance, and seeks to divert his mind from the gloomy
contemplation of death and the ephemeral character of mortal joys by
urging his friend to join in the pleasure of the hour, and by
suggesting the probability of an after life.</p>

<p>1. <i>xochicalco</i>; compounded of <i>xochitl</i>, flower; <i>calli</i>, house; and
the postposition, <i>co</i>. The term was applied to any room decorated
with flowers; here, to the mortuary chamber, which Tezozomoc tells us
was decked with roses and brilliant feathers.</p>

<p><i>ipalnemohuani</i>, literally "the one by whom life exists." The
composition is <i>i</i>, possessive pronoun, third person, singular;
<i>pal</i>, postposition, by; <i>nemoani</i>, singular of the present in <i>ni</i>
of the impersonal form of the verb <i>nemi</i>, to live, with the meaning
to do habitually that which the verb expresses. It is an ancient
epithet applied to the highest divinity, and is found in the <i>Codex
Telleriano-Remensis</i>, Kingsborough's <i>Mexico</i>, Vol. VI, p. 128, note.</p>

<p><i>tolquatectitlan</i>, from <i>toloa</i>, to lower, to bow; <i>quatequia</i>, to
immerse the head; <i>tlan</i>, place ending. In the ancient funeral
ceremonies the faces of the assistants were laved with holy water. On
this rite see the note of Orozco y Berra to his edition of the
<i>Cronica Mexicana</i> of Tezozomoc, p. 435 (Mexico, 1878).</p>

<p><i>xoyacaltitlan</i>; from <i>xoyaui</i>, to spoil, to decay, whence
<i>xoyauhqui</i>, rank, unpleasant, like the odor of decaying substances.</p>

<p><i>xochicopal tlenamactli</i>, "the incense of sweet copal," which was
burned in the funeral chamber (see Tezozomoc's description of the
obsequies of Axayaca, <i>Cron. Mex.</i>, cap. 55).</p>

<p>2. The translation of this verse offers some special difficulties.</p>

<a name="NOTES_IV"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG IV.</h3>

<p>A poem of unusually rich metaphors is presented, with the title "A
Song of the Mexicans, after the manner of the Otomis." It is a
rhapsody, in which the bard sings his "faculty divine," and describes
the intoxication of the poetic inspiration. It has every inherent
mark of antiquity, and its thought is free from any tincture of
European influence.</p>

<p>2. <i>miahuatototl</i>, literally, "the corn-silk bird," <i>miahua</i> being
the term applied to the silk or tassel of the maize ear when in the
milk. I have not found its scientific designation.</p>

<p>6. <i>poyomatl</i>; the poyomatli is described by Sahagun (<i>Hist. de la
Nueva España</i>, Lib. X, cap. 24) as a species of rose, portions of
which were used to fill the cane tubes or pipes used for smoking. He
names it along with certain fungi employed for the same purpose, and
it probably produced a narcotic effect.</p>

<a name="NOTES_V"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG V.</h3>

<p>From the wording, this appears to be one of the lost songs of
Nezahualcoyotl, either composed by him or sung before him. (See the
Introduction, p. 35.) It is a funeral dirge, dwelling on the fact of
universal and inevitable death, and the transitoriness of life. There
is in it no hint of Christian consolation, no comfortable hope of
happiness beyond the grave. Hence it dates, in all likelihood, from a
period anterior to the arrival of the missionaries.</p>

<p>1. <i>tonequimilol</i>; I take this to be a derivative from <i>quimiloa</i>, to
wrap up, especially, to shroud the dead, to wrap the corpse in its
winding sheets, as was the custom of the ancient Mexicans. The word,
however, seems an archaic form, as it does not lend itself readily to
analysis.</p>

<p>The expression <i>in Dios</i>, I explain as in the note to II, 1, and do
not consider that it detracts from the authentic antiquity of the
poem.</p>

<p>2. <i>yoyontzin</i>; on the significance of this appellation of
Nezahualcoyotl, see Introduction, p. 35.</p>

<p>3. <i>ti Nezahualcoyotl</i>; "thou Nezahualcoyotl." The princely poet may
have addressed himself in this expression, or we may suppose the song
was chanted before him.</p>

<p>5. <i>Nopiltzin</i>; the reference is to Quetzalcoatl, the famous "fair
God" of the Nahuas, and in myth, the last ruler of the Toltecs. See
D.G. Brinton, <i>American Hero Myths</i> (Philadelphia, 1882). The term
means "my beloved Lord." On Tezozomoc, see Introduction, p. 35.</p>

<p>6. The text of the latter part or refrain of verses 5 and 6 is
corrupt, and my translation is doubtful.</p>

<a name="NOTES_VI"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG VI.</h3>

<p>Most of the poems in this collection are not assigned to any author,
but this, and apparently the one following, are recorded as the
compositions of Tetlapan Quetzanitzin. He is evidently the personage
spoken of by Sahagun as "King of Tlacopan," as present with Montezuma
on the occasion of his first interview with Cortez. Later in the
struggle Tetlapan appears as the associate of Quauhtemoctzin, the
"King of Mexico." (See Sahagun, <i>Hist. de la Nueva España</i>, Lib. XII,
cap. 16 and 40.) M. Rémi Simeon explains the name to mean "he who
deceives the people by magic;" deriving it from <i>quetza</i>, he places;
<i>te</i>, the people, <i>tlepan</i>, on the fire. A simpler derivation seems
to me possible from <i>tetlapanqui</i>, miner, or quarryman (literally,
stone-breaker), and <i>quetzalli</i>, red; <i>quetzatzin</i>, the lord or
master of the miners.</p>

<p>Both this and the following are war songs, and have marked similarity
in thought and wording. The introduction of the Spanish <i>Dios</i> was
doubtless substituted by the scribe, for the name of some native god
of war, perhaps Huitzilopochtli.</p>

<p>1. <i>Aua</i>; this word I take to be a form of the interjection <i>yahue</i>,
or, as Olmos gives it in his <i>Grammar, aa</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>nepohualoyan</i>; "the place of counting or reckoning," from
<i>pohua</i>, to count. The reference is not clear, and the translation
uncertain. In some parts of ancient Mexico they used in their
accounting knotted cords of various colors, like the Peruvian
<i>quipus</i>. These were called <i>nepohualtzitzin</i>.</p>

<p>4. This verse is remarkable for its sonorous phrases and the archaic
forms of the words. Its translation offers considerable difficulty.</p>

<p><i>xontlachayan</i>, I take to be an imperative form from <i>tlachia</i>, to
look, with the euphonic <i>on</i>.</p>

<p><i>teoatl tlachinolli</i>, literally "the divine water (i.e. blood), the
burning," and the expression means war, battle. In one of his sermons
Fray Juan Bautista describes the fall of Jericho in the words,
<i>otlaltitechya in altepetl teuatl tlachinolli ye opoliuh</i>, and
explains it, "the town was destroyed with fire and blood" (<i>Sermones
en Lengua Mexicana</i>, p. 122). The word <i>tlachinolli</i> is from
<i>chinoa</i>, to burn.</p>

<p><i>quetzalalpilo</i>; a compound of <i>quetzalli</i>, a beautiful feather, and
<i>tlalpiloni</i>, the band which passed around the head to keep the hair
in place.</p>

<p>5. <i>melchiquiuhticaya</i>; "he who presented his breast," an imperfect,
reflexive form. Molina gives <i>melchiquiuh petlauhqui</i>, with the
translation <i>despechugado</i>. <i>Vocabulario Mexicana, s.v.</i></p>

<a name="NOTES_VII"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG VII.</h3>

<p>The second specimen from the muse of Tetlapan Quetzanitzin is the
noblest war song in the collection. It is an appeal to his friends to
join in a foray to Chiapas. The intoxication of the battle field is
compared to that produced by the strong white wine prepared from
maguey, which was drunk only on solemn occasions. The bard likens the
exhaustion of his fellow warriors from previous conflicts, to the
stupor which follows a debauch, and he exhorts them to throw it
aside.</p>

<p>1. <i>oamaxque</i>, <i>o</i>, pret. <i>am</i>, you, <i>axque</i>, 2d pl. pret. from <i>ay</i>,
to do.</p>

<p><i>octicatl</i>, apparently an old form from <i>octli</i>, the intoxicating
beverage prepared from the maguey.</p>

<p><i>oanquique</i>, 2d pl. pret. from <i>cui</i>, to take.</p>

<p><i>ohuican</i>, a place of difficulty and danger. The frequent addition of
the terminal <i>o</i> in this and the succeeding verses is merely
euphonic.</p>

<p>2. <i>teoatl tlachinolli</i>; see note VI, 4.</p>

<p><i>in maquiztli tlazotetl</i>, the beloved jewels, a phrase which
indicates that the broken stones and splintered emeralds referred to
are the young warriors who fall in battle, the pride of their
parents' hearts, who are destroyed in the fight.</p>

<p>The <i>tizaoctli</i>, white wine (<i>tizatl</i>, chalk, hence white, and
<i>octli</i>, wine), referred to in this passage, is said by Sahagun to
have been drunk especially at the feast of the god Papaztac, one of
the many gods of the wine cup. <i>Hist. de Nueva España</i>. Lib. II, App.
Tezozomoc mentions it as handed to the mourners at funeral
ceremonies. <i>Cronica Mexicana</i>, cap. 55.</p>

<p>3. <i>xochitlalticpacilhtuicacpao</i>; in this long compound of <i>xochitl</i>,
flower, <i>tlalti</i>, earth, and <i>ilhuicatl</i>, sky, with various
postpositions and the euphonic terminal <i>o</i>, the final <i>pa</i> gives the
sense of location, towards, in the direction of.</p>

<p><i>chimalxochiti</i>; "the shield flower," the shield or buckler of the
ancient warriors, ornamented with tassels and feathers, is not
unaptly called the flower of war.</p>

<a name="NOTES_VIII"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG VIII.</h3>

<p>The entire absence in this lament for the dead of any consolation
drawn from Christian doctrines, points clearly to a date for its
composition earlier than the teachings of the missionaries. Its cry
of woe is hopeless, and the title attributes its authorship to one of
the old chieftains, <i>tlatoani</i>, who held the power before the
Spaniard arrived.</p>

<p>1. <i>quetzalhuahuaciuhtoque</i>, from <i>quetzalli, huaqui</i>; <i>in
teintoque</i>, the splinters; the same simile is employed in VII, 2.</p>

<p>2. <i>ximoayan</i>, see note to I, 8. The occurrence of this term here and
in verse 3 testifies to the fact of a composition outside of
Christian influences.</p>

<a name="NOTES_IX"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG IX.</h3>

<p>The title does not necessarily mean that this song is a translation
from the Otomi language, but merely that the time to which it was
chanted was in the Otomi style; or, the term <i>Otomi</i> may have
reference to the military officer so called. The word is perhaps a
compound of <i>otli</i>, path, and <i>mitl</i>, arrow.</p>

<p>The bard sings the vanity of earthly pleasures, and the reality of
earthly pains; he exhorts himself and his hearers not to neglect the
duties of religion, and lauds his own skill in song, which he
compares to the sweet voices of melodious birds. There is nothing in
the poem which reflects European influence.</p>

<p>1. <i>xotlacueponi</i>; the meaning of this compound is obscure. It is not
found in the dictionaries.</p>

<p>2. The terminal <i>o</i> is inserted several times in the passage to
express emotion and fill the metre.</p>

<p><i>mixitl tlapatl</i>. A phrase signifying the stupor or drunkenness that
comes from swallowing or smoking narcotic plants. See Olmos,
<i>Grammaire de la Langue Nahuatl</i>, pp. 223, 228; <i>oquiqueo</i> is from
<i>i</i>, to drink, or <i>cui</i>, to take, the <i>o</i> terminal being euphonic.</p>

<a name="NOTES_X"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG X.</h3>

<p>The poet expresses his grief that his songs all dwell on painful
topics; he exhorts his hearers of the vanity of fame and skill in
handicrafts, and of the uncertainty of life; closing, he appeals
especially to those of Tezcuco and Atecpan to listen and believe his
warnings.</p>

<p>In spite of the introduction of the Spanish word <i>Dios</i>, and the
exhortation to "believe," in the last line, it is possible that the
substance of this song was due to purely native inspiration; yet it
may have been, like Song XIX, one of those written at an early period
for the converts by the missionaries.</p>

<a name="NOTES_XI"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG XI.</h3>

<p>In a similar strain as in the last poem, the bard bewails the
briefness of human life and friendships. He closes with an appeal to
the Master of Life, of whom no mortal tongue can speak in worthy and
appropriate terms.</p>

<p>6. <i>ihuiti</i>, apparently a form of <i>ihuintia</i>.</p>

<p><i>tonan</i>; the reference appears to be to <i>Tonantzin</i>, Our Mother,
otherwise known as Cihuacoatl, the Serpent Woman. She was the
mythical mother of the human race, and dispensed afflictions and
adverse fortune. See Sahagun, <i>Hist. de la Nueva España</i>, Lib. I,
cap. 6. The name is a proof of the antiquity of the poem, which is
throughout in the spirit of the ancient religion.</p>

<a name="NOTES_XII"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG XII.</h3>

<p>As stated in the Introduction (§ 10), a note prefixed to this song
introduces it as a translation from the Otomi into the Nahuatl
tongue. It admirably illustrates the poetic flexibility of the
Nahuatl.</p>

<p>3. <i>epoyhuayan</i>, from <i>epoalli</i>, sixty; <i>teoquauhtli ocelott</i>,
"divine eagles, tigers." These terms refer to the warriors bearing
these titles.</p>

<p><i>tlazomaquiztetl</i>, "beloved, precious stones," a figure of speech
referring to the youths who go to war. The same or similar metaphors
are used in previous songs.</p>

<p>5. The fifth and sixth verses present serious difficulties of
construction which I do not flatter myself I have overcome.</p>

<a name="NOTES_XIII"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG XIII.</h3>

<p>The inhabitants of Huexotzinco were in frequent strife with those of
Mexico-Tenochtitlan, and on various occasions the latter captured
many prisoners. The present poem is represented to be a composition
of one of these prisoners when he and his companions were confined in
Tlatilolco, one of the suburbs of Tenochtitlan. It breathes hatred
against his captors and an ardent thirst for vengeance. The latest
date at which I find captives from Huexotzinco detained in Mexico is
1511, and it is to this year, therefore, that I assign the
composition of the poem.</p>

<p>5. <i>Atloyantepetl</i>; this name possibly means "the mountain of the
place of the water-falcons" (<i>atl</i>, water; <i>tlatli</i>, falcon; <i>yan</i>,
place-ending; <i>tepetl</i>, mountain). I have not found it in other
writers. (See Index.)</p>

<p>8. <i>tlaylotlaqui</i>; Siméon, on the authority of Aubin, explains this
term as the name of a tribe living near Tezcuco. In derivation it
appears to be a term of contempt, "workers in filth or refuse," scum,
offscourings. It also appears in Song XV.</p>

<p>10. The construction of this verse is so obscure, or the text so
imperfect, that the translation is doubtful.</p>

<a name="NOTES_XIV"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG XIV.</h3>

<p>This poem, chanted in 1551 before the Governor of Azcapotzalco, by
Francisco Placido, a native of Huexotzinco, is a Christian song in
the style and metre of the ancient poetry. See the Introduction, p.
51.</p>

<p>1. <i>impetlatl</i>; the ordinary meaning of <i>petlatl</i> is a mat or rug; it
is here to be taken in its figurative sense of power or authority,
chiefs and other prominent persons being provided with mats at the
councils, etc.</p>

<a name="NOTES_XV"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG XV.</h3>

<p>This extremely difficult composition seems to be a war song, in which
the bard refers to the traditional history of the Nahuas, names some
of their most prominent warriors, and incites his hearers to deeds of
prowess on the battle field. I do not claim for my version more than
a general correspondence to the thought of the original. In several
parts, especially verse 18, the text is obviously defective.</p>

<p>1. <i>tzihuactitlan</i>; "the land of the tzihuac bushes." The tzihuactli
is a small kind of maguey which grows in rocky localities. The tenth
edifice of the great temple at Tenochtitlan was a wall surrounding an
artificial rockery planted with these bushes. Sahagun, who mentions
this fact, adds that the name of this edifice was <i>Teotlalpan</i>, which
literally means "on holy ground." (<i>Hist. de la Nueva España</i>, Lib.
II, App.) The <i>mizquitl</i> is the common <i>Mimosa circinalis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Chicomoztoc</i>; "at the Seven Caves," a famous locality in Mexican
legend, and the supposed birthplace of their race.</p>

<p>2. <i>Colhuacan</i> is probably for Acolhuacan; the early rulers of the
latter were of the blood of the Chichimec chiefs of the Tepanecas.</p>

<p>4. <i>Hueytlalpan</i>, "at the ancient land," perhaps for Huetlapallan, a
1ocality often referred to in the migration myths of the Nahuas.</p>

<p>5. <i>Atloyan</i>; see note to XIII, 6.</p>

<p>9. The ceiba and cypress trees were employed figuratively to indicate
protection and safeguard. See Olmos, <i>Gram. de la Langue Nahuatl</i>, p.
211.</p>

<p>12. On <i>tlailotlaqui</i>, see note to XIII, 8. The interjectional
appendages to this and the following verse are increased.</p>

<p>15. Tepeyacan was the name of a mountain on which before the Conquest
was a temple dedicated to the "Mother of our Life," Tonantzin.</p>

<p>16. <i>tlapalcayocan</i>, "the place of shards," of broken pieces, i.e.,
the field of battle.</p>

<p>19. The word <i>totomihuacan</i>, which has already occurred in vv. 3 and
7, I have translated as referring to the war captains of the Mexican
armies, called <i>otomi</i> (see Bandelier, <i>On the Art of War of the
Ancient Mexicans</i>, p. 117). I am quite open for correction however.</p>

<p>27. <i>in ipetl icpal</i>; in a translation of an ancient song,
Ixtlilxochitl renders the expression <i>in ipetl icpal in teotl</i>, "en
el trono y tribunal de Dios," <i>Historia Chichimeca</i>, cap. 32.</p>

<p>29. <i>Mictlan</i>; the place of departed souls in Aztec mythology.</p>

<a name="NOTES_XVI"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG XVI.</h3>

<p>In this stirring war-song, the poet reproaches his friends for their
lukewarmness in the love of battle. He reminds them that life is
transitory, and the dead rise not again, and that the greatest joy of
the brave is on the ringing field of fray where warriors win renown.
It is in the spirit of the Scotch harper:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Twere worth ten years of peaceful life,</p>

<p>One hour of such a day."</p>

<p>1. Each verse terminates with an interjectional refrain. The frequent
introduction of the particle <i>on</i> is intended to add strength and
gravity to the oration.</p>

<p>2. <i>oppan piltihua</i>. Compare this expression with that in v. 22, p.
44.</p>

<p>3. <i>xochimicohuayan</i>, should perhaps be translated, "where the
captives to be immolated to the Gods are taken." The <i>xochimique</i>,
"those destined to a flowery death" were the captives who were
reserved for sacrifice to the gods. See Joan Bautista, <i>Sermonario en
Lengua Mexicana</i>, p. 180.</p>

<p>4. <i>yaoxochimiquiztica</i>, "pertaining to the slaughter of the flowery
war." This adjective refers to the peculiar institution of the
"flowery war," <i>guerra florida</i>, which obtained among the ancient
Mexicans. It appears to have been a contest without provocation, and
merely for the display of prowess and to take captives to supply the
demand for human sacrifices in the religious rites. On this see
Tezozomoc, <i>Cronica Mexicana</i>, cap. 96.</p>

<a name="NOTES_XVII"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG XVII.</h3>

<p>In this long fragment&mdash;the closing strophes are missing in my
MS.&mdash;the bard represents himself as a stranger appearing before the
nobles of Huexotzinco at some festival. The first two verses appear
to be addressed to him by the nobles. They ask him to bring forth his
drum and sing. He begins with a laudation of the power of music,
proceeds to praise the noble company present, and touches those
regretful chords, so common in the Nahuatl poetry, which hint at the
ephemeral nature of all joy and the certainty of death and oblivion.
An appeal is made to the Master of Life who inspires the soul of the
poet, and whose praises should be ever in mind.</p>

<p>The words <i>Dios</i> and <i>angelotin</i>, in verse 26th, indicate that the
poem has received some "recension" by the Spanish copyist; but the
general tone impresses me as quite aboriginal in character.</p>

<p>2. <i>quauhtlocelotl</i>, see note to I, 5.</p>

<p>3. In this verse, as frequently elsewhere, the syllable ya is
introduced merely to complete the metre. Ordinarily it is the sign of
the imperfect tense, and has other meanings (see the Vocabulary), but
in many instances does not admit of translation.</p>

<p>8. <i>noncoati</i>, for <i>ni-on-coatl</i>, I am a guest.</p>

<p>18. The references in this verse are obscure, and I doubt if I have
solved them.</p>

<p>20. "The house of spring;" compare the expression in v. 1, of
Nezahualcoyotl's song, p. 42.</p>

<p>21. A long oration of Xicontecatl, lord of Tizatlan, may be found in
Clavigero, <i>Hist. Antica di Messico</i>, Tom. III, p. 40. The expression
in <i>camaxochitzin</i>, from <i>camatl</i>, mouth, <i>xochitl</i>, rose, flower,
and the reverential <i>tzin</i>, is noteworthy.</p>

<p>24. <i>petlacoatl</i>, the centipede or scolopender; from <i>petlatl</i>, mat,
and <i>coatl</i>, serpent, as they are said to intertwine with each other,
like the threads of a mat (Sahagun, Lib. XII, cap. 4).</p>

<a name="NOTES_XVIII"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG XVIII.</h3>

<p>At this portion of the MS. several poems are preceded by a line of
syllables indicating their accompaniment on the teponaztli (see
Introduction, p. 32).</p>

<p>The present number is one of the most noteworthy songs of the
collection. It belongs to the ancient cyclus of Quetzalcoatl myths,
and gives a brief relation of the destruction of Tollan and the
departure and disappearance of the Light God, Quetzalcoatl Ce Acatl.
As I have elsewhere collated this typical myth at length, and
interpreted it according to the tenets of modern mythologic science,
I shall not dwell upon it here (see D.G. Brinton, <i>American Hero
Myths</i>, Phila., 1882).</p>

<p>The text of the poem is quite archaic, and presents many
difficulties. But my translation, I think, gives the general sense
correctly.</p>

<p>1. <i>huapalcalli</i>; literally, "the house constructed of beams." This
name was applied to the chief temple of the Toltecs; the ruins of an
ancient structure at Tollantzinco were pointed out at the time of the
Conquest as those of this building (see Sahagun, <i>Hist. de la Nueva
España</i>, Lib. X, cap. 29).</p>

<p><i>coatlaquetzalli</i>; this edifice, said to have been left incomplete by
Quetzalcoatl, when he forsook Tollan, had pillars in the form of a
serpent, the head at the base, the tail at the top of the pillar.
(See Orozco y Berra, <i>Hist. Antigua de Mexico</i>, Tom. III, pp. 30 and
46.) The structure is mentioned as follows in the <i>Anales de
Cuauhtitlan</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Auh iniquac nemia Quetzalcoatl quitzintica, quipeuahtica iteocal
quimaman coatlaquetzali ihuan amo quitzonquixti, amo quipantlaz."</i></p>

<p>"And when Quetzalcoatl was living, he began and commenced the temple
of his which is the Coatlaquetzali (Serpent Plumes), and he did not
finish it, he did not fully erect it."</p>

<p><i>Nacxitl Topiltzin</i>, "Our Lord the four-footed." <i>Nacxitl</i> appears to
have been the name of Quetzalcoatl, in his position as lord of the
merchants. Compare Sahagun, ubi supra, Lib. I, cap. 19.</p>

<p>2. <i>Poyauhtecatl</i>, a volcano near Orizaba, mentioned by Sahagun.
<i>Acallan</i>, a province bordering on the Laguna de los Terminos. The
myth reported that Quetzalcoatl journeyed to the shores of the Gulf
about the isthmus of Tehuantepec and there disappeared.</p>

<p>3. <i>Nonohualco</i>; the reference is to the <i>cerro de Nonoalco</i>, which
plays a part in the Quetzalcoatl myth. The words of the song are
almost those of Tezcatlipoca when he is introduced to Quetzalcoatl.
Asked whence he came, he replied, "Nihuitz in Nonohualcatepetl
itzintla, etc." (<i>Anales de Cuauhtitlan</i>).</p>

<p>4. The occurrences alluded to are the marvels performed by
Quetzalcoatl on his journey from Tulan. See my American Hero Myths,
p. 115.</p>

<p>5. The departure of Quetzalcoatl was because he was ordered to repair
to Tlapallan, supposed to be beyond Xicalanco.</p>

<p>8. <i>quinti</i>, for <i>iquintia</i>; the reference is to the magic draught
given Quetzalcoatl by Tezcatlipoca.</p>

<p>9. <i>In tetl, in quahuitl</i>; literally, "stone and stick;" a very
common phrase in Nahautl, to signify misfortunes.</p>

<a name="NOTES_XIX"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG XIX.</h3>

<p>In this song we have avowedly a specimen of an early chant prepared
probably by Bishop Zummarraga for the native converts. The
accompaniment on the teponaztli is marked at the beginning. The
language is noticeably different from the hymn to Quetzalcoatl just
given (XVIII).</p>

<a name="NOTES_XX"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG XX.</h3>

<p>Another song of the antique Quetzalcoatl cyclus. It bewails the loss
of Tulan, and the bard seeks in vain for any joyous theme to inspire
his melody, reflecting on all that has bloomed in glory and now is
gone forever.</p>

<p>3. <i>Tetl-quahitl</i>; see note to XVIII, 9.</p>

<a name="NOTES_XXI"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG XXI.</h3>

<p>The occurrence to which this poem alludes took place about the year
1507. The chroniclers state that it was in the early period of the
reign of Montezuma II, that the natives of Huexotzinco, at that time
allies of the Mexicans, were severely harassed by the Tlascallans,
and applied, not in vain, to their powerful suzerain to aid them.
(See Tezozomoc, <i>Cronica Mexicana</i>, cap. 97.)</p>

<p>The poet does not appear to make a direct petition, but indirectly
praises the grandeur of Montezuma and expresses his own ardent love
for his native Huexotzinco. The song would appear to be used as a
delicate prelude to the more serious negotiations. It is one of the
few historical songs in the collection. From the references in verses
1 and 3 we infer that this singer held in his hand the painted book
from which he recited the couplets. This may explain the presentation
of the piece.</p>

<p>1. <i>huetzcani</i>; one who laughs, a jester, perhaps the designation of
one who sang cheerful songs.</p>

<p><i>chalchiuhatlaquiquizcopa</i>; a. word of difficult analysis. I suspect
an omission of an <i>l</i>, and that the compound includes <i>tlaquilqui</i>,
one who fastens and puts together, a mason, etc.</p>

<p>5. The sense is that the warriors of Montezuma when on the field of
battle, shine in their deeds like beautiful flowers in a field, and
win lasting fame by their exploits.</p>

<p><i>mopopoyauhtoc</i>. The grammarian Olmos explains the reflexive verb
<i>mopopoyauhtiuh</i> to signify "he leaves an honored memory of his
exploits." See Siméon, <i>Dictionaire de la Langue Nahuatl</i>, sub voce.</p>

<p>7. <i>Huexotzinco atzalan</i>; "Huexotzinco amid the waters." This
expression, repeated in verse 8, appears inappropriate to the town of
Huexotzinco, which lies inland. In fact, the description in verse 7
applies to Tenochtitlan rather than the singer's own town. But the
text does not admit this translation. Perhaps we should read
"Huexotzinco and Atzalan," as there are yet two villages of that name
in the state of Puebla (which embraced part of ancient Huexotzinco).</p>

<p>10. <i>petiatolini</i>, I have derived from <i>petlatl</i>, suspecting an error
in transcription. The reference is to the rushes in the mat on which
the singer stood.</p>

<a name="NOTES_XXII"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG XXII.</h3>

<p>The ordinary sad burden of the Nahuatl poets is repeated with
emphasis in this plaint. It is a variation of the Epicurean advice,
"Eat, drink, and be merry, for to-morrow we die." Both the sentiment
and the reference to Mictlan in verse 7, point it out as a production
uninfluenced by Christian teaching.</p>

<p>7. The word <i>ahuicaloyan</i>, place of sweetness, would seem to be
identical with <i>ohuicaloyan</i>, place of difficulty, in v. 8; I have
regarded the latter as an error of transcription.</p>

<a name="NOTES_XXIII"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG XXIII.</h3>

<p>Although No. V. is probably one of the lost songs of Nezahualcoyotl,
the present is the only one of the collection which is definitely
attributed to him. The language is very archaic, and in the sentiment
there is every mark of antiquity.</p>

<p>The text is apparently a dialogue, which was chanted as strophe and
antistrophe, the one singer speaking for the King, the other for the
bard himself.</p>

<p>The word <i>teotl</i> is used for divinity, and it is doubtless this word
for which the copyists of some of the other songs have substituted
the Spanish <i>Dios</i>, thus conveying an impression that the chants
themselves were of late date.</p>

<p>The last verse, however, seems to be by one who lives after the time
of the great poet-prince, and is calling him to memory.</p>

<a name="NOTES_XXIV"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG XXIV.</h3>

<p>It will be seen that there is a wearisome sameness in the theme of
most of the short poems. Probably the bards followed conventional
models, and feared for the popularity of their products, did they
seek originality. Here again are the same delight in flowers and
songs, and the same grief at the thought that all such joys are
evanescent and that soon "death closes all."</p>

<p>I consider the poem one of undoubted antiquity and purely native in
thought and language.</p>

<a name="NOTES_XXV"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG XXV.</h3>

<p>The destruction of the Mexican state was heralded by a series of
omens and prodigies which took place at various times during the ten
years preceding the arrival of Cortes. They are carefully recorded by
Sahagun, in the first chapter of the 12th book of his history. They
included a comet, or "smoking star," as these were called in Nahuatl,
and a bright flame in the East and Southeast, over the mountains,
visible from midnight to daylight, for a year. This latter occurred
in 1509. The song before us is a boding chant, referring to such
prognostics, and drawing from them the inference that the existence
of Mexico was doomed. It was probably from just such songs that
Sahagun derived his information.</p>

<p>1. <i>toztliyan</i>, I suppose from <i>tozquitl</i>, the singing voice, in the
locative; literally, "the quechol in the place of sweet-singing."</p>

<p>2. <i>iquiapan</i>, from <i>i</i>, possessive prefix, <i>quiauatl</i>, door,
entrance, house, <i>pan</i>, in.</p>

<p>5. An obscure verse; <i>tequantepec</i>, appears to be a textual error;
<i>tequani</i>, a ravenous beast, from <i>qua</i> to eat; <i>tepec</i>, a mountain;
but <i>tequantepehua</i> occurring twice later in the poem induces the
belief <i>tequani</i> should be taken in its figurative sense of
affliction, destruction, and that <i>tepec</i> is an old verbal form.</p>

<p>7. <i>Xochitecatl</i>, "one who cares for flowers," is said by Sahagun to
have been the name applied to a woman doomed to sacrifice to the
divinities of the mountains (<i>Hist. Nueva España</i>, Lib. II, cap. 13).</p>

<p>8. <i>amaxtecatl</i>, or <i>amoxtecatl</i>, as the MS. may read, from
<i>amoxtli</i>, a book.</p>

<a name="NOTES_XXVI"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG XXVI.</h3>

<p>This seems to be a song of victory to celebrate an attack upon
Atlixco by the ruler of Tezcuco, the famous Nezahualpilli. This
monarch died in 1516, and therefore the song must antedate this
period, if it is genuine. It has every intrinsic evidence of
antiquity, and I think may justly be classed among those preserved
from a time anterior to the Conquest. According to the chronologies
preserved, the attack of Nezahualpilli upon Atlixco was in the year
XI <i>tochtli</i>, which corresponds to 1490, two years before the
discovery by Columbus (see Orozco y Berra, <i>Hist. Antigua de Mexico</i>,
Tom. III, p. 399).</p>

<a name="NOTES_XXVII"></a><h3>NOTES FOR SONG XXVII.</h3>

<p>My MS. closes with a Christian song in the style of the ancient
poetry. It is valuable as indicating the linguistic differences
between these later productions of the sixteenth century and those
earlier ones, such as XXVI, which I have not hesitated to assign to
an epoch before the Spaniards landed upon the shores of New Spain.</p>

<a name="INDEX"></a><h2>INDEX OF NAHUATL PROPER NAMES, WITH EXPLANATIONS.</h2>
<p>
ACALLAN, 105. "The place of boats," from <i>acalli</i>, boat. An ancient
province at the mouth of the Usumacinta river; but the name was
probably applied to other localities also.
</p>
<p>
ACATLAPAN, 41. A village southeast of Chalco. From <i>acatla</i>, a place
of reeds, and <i>pan</i>, in or at.
</p>
<p>
ACHALCHIUHTLANEXTIN, 46. The first chief of the Toltecs; another form
of <i>chalchiuhtonac</i>. Both names mean "the gleam of the precious
jade." Compare Torquemada, <i>Monarquia Indiana</i>. Lib. III., cap. 7;
Orozco y Berra, <i>Hist. Antigua de Mexico</i>, Tom. III., p. 42. The date
of the beginning of his reign is put at A.D. 667 or 700.
</p>
<p>
ACOLHUACAN, 40, 91, 119. A compound of <i>atl</i>, water, and <i>colhuacan</i>,
(q. v.) = "Colhuacan by the water," the name of the state of which
Tetzcuco was the capital, in the valley of Mexico.
</p>
<p>
ACOLMIZTLAN, 89, from
</p>
<p>
ACOLMIZTLI, 35. A name of Nezahualcoyotl (see p. 35), also of other
warriors.
</p>
<p>
ANAHUAC, 125. From <i>atl</i>, water, <i>nahuac</i>, by, = the land by the
water. The term was applied first to the land by the lakes in the
Valley of Mexico, and later to that along both the Gulf of Mexico and
the Pacific Ocean.
</p>
<p>
ATECPAN, 77. "The royal residence by the water" (<i>atl, tecpan</i>). I do
not find this locality mentioned elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
ATLIXCO, 125. "Where the water shows its face" (<i>atl, ixtli, co</i>). A
locality southeast of Tezcuco, near the lake, so called from a large
spring. See Motolinia, <i>Historia de los Indios</i>, Trat. III, cap. 18.
</p>
<p>
ATLOYANTEPETL, 85, 89, 91. Perhaps for <i>atlauantepetl</i>, "the mountain
that rules the waters." But see note to XIII, v. 6.
</p>
<p>
ATZALAN, 114. "Amid the waters" (<i>atl, tzalan</i>). Perhaps not a proper
name; but two villages in the present State of Puebla are called
Atzala (see Orozco y Berra, <i>Geografia de las Lenguas de Mexico</i>, pp.
212, 213).
</p>
<p>
AXAXACATZIN, 43. Probably for <i>axayacatzin</i>, reverential of
<i>axayacatl</i>, the name of a species of marsh fly. It was also the name
of the sixth ruler of Mexico (flor. about 1500), and doubtless of
other distinguished persons. See Ixtlilxochitl, <i>Historia
Chichimeca</i>, cap. 51.
</p>
<p>
AZCAPOTZALCO, 50, 51. An ancient town in the valley of Mexico, once
the capital city of the Tepanecas (q. v.). The word means "place of
the ant-hills," from <i>azcaputzalli</i>.
</p>
<p>
AZTECS, 25. A Nahuatl tribe who derived their name from their
mythical ancient home, Aztlan. The derivation is obscure, but
probably is from the same radical as <i>iztac</i>, white, and, therefore,
Father Duran was right in translating Aztlan, "place of whiteness,"
the reference being to the East, whence the Aztecs claim to have
come. See Duran, <i>Historia de las Indias</i>, cap. II.
</p>
<p>
CACAMATL, 94, 95. The reference appears to be to Cacamatzin (the
<i>Noble Sad One</i>, from <i>cacamaua</i>, fig. to be sad), last ruler of
Tezcuco, son and successor, in 1516, of Nezahualpilli. He was put to
death by Cortes.
</p>
<p>
CATOCIH, 89. A doubtful word, which may not be a proper name.
</p>
<p>
CHALCO, 16, 69, 95. A town and lake in the valley of Mexico. The
people were Nahuas and subject to Mexico. The word is probably
derived from <i>Challi</i>, with the postpos. <i>co</i>, meaning "at the mouth"
(of a river). See Buschmann, <i>Ueber die Aztekischen Ortsnamen</i>, s.
689, and comp. <i>Codex Ramirez</i>, p. 18.
</p>
<p>
CHIAPA, CHIAPANECA, 70, 71. The province and inhabitants of Chiapas,
in Southern Mexico. There were colonies of Nahuas in Chiapas, though
most of the natives spoke other tongues. The derivation is probably
from <i>chia</i>, a mucilaginous seed highly esteemed in Mexico.
</p>
<p>
CHICHIMECATL or CHICHIMECS, 88, 89, 91, 101. A rude hunting tribe,
speaking Nahuatl, who settled, in early times, in the valley of
Mexico. The name was said to be derived from <i>chichi</i>, a dog, on
account of their devotion to hunting (<i>Cod. Ramirez</i>). Others say it
was that of their first chieftain.
</p>
<p>
CHICOMOZTOC, 88, 89. "At the seven caves," the name of the mythical
locality from which the seven Nahuatl tribes derived their origin.
The <i>Codex Ramirez</i> explains the seven caves to mean the seven houses
or lineages (totems) of which the nation consisted.
</p>
<p>
CHILILITLI, 36. Name of a tower of sacred import. It is apparently a
compound of <i>chia</i> or <i>chielia</i>, to watch, and <i>tlilli</i>, blackness,
obscurity, hence "a night watch-tower." It was probably used for the
study of the sky at night.
</p>
<p>
CHIMALPOPOCA, 43. "The smoking shield," from <i>chimalli</i>, shield, and
<i>popoca</i>. The name of several distinguished warriors and rulers in
ancient Mexico.
</p>
<p>
CHOLULA or CHOLOLLAN, 105. Name of a celebrated ancient state and
city. From <i>choloa</i>, with the probable meaning, "place of refuge,"
"place of the fugitives."
</p>
<p>
CIHUAPAN, 41. Name of a warrior, otherwise unknown. From <i>cihuatl</i>,
woman, <i>pan</i>, among, with.
</p>
<p>
COATZITEUCTLI, 89. A name compound of <i>coatzin</i>, reverential form of
<i>coatl</i>, serpent, and <i>teuctli</i>, lord.
</p>
<p>
COLHUA, A people of Nahuatl affinity, who dwelt in ancient times in
the valley of Mexico. See <i>Colhuacan</i>.
</p>
<p>
COLHUACAN, 88, 89, 91. A town in the valley of Mexico. In spite of
the arguments to the contrary, I believe the Colhua were of Nahuatl
lineage, and that the name is derived from <i>colli</i>, ancestor;
<i>colhuacan</i>, the residence of the ancestors; with this signification,
it was applied to many localities. It must be distinguished from
<i>Acolhuacan</i>. Its ikonomatic symbol was a hill bent over at the top,
from <i>coloa</i>, to bend.
</p>
<p>
COLZAZTLI, 39. Probably for Coltzatztli, one who cries out or calls
to the ancestors (<i>colli, tzatzia</i>). A chief whom I have not found
elsewhere mentioned.
</p>
<p>
CONAHUATZIN, 41. A warrior not elsewhere mentioned. By derivation it
means "noble son of the lord of the water" (<i>conetl, ahua, tzin</i>).
</p>
<p>
CUETZPALTZIN, 89. A proper name, from <i>cuetzpalli</i>, the 4th day of
the month.
</p>
<p>
CUEXTLA, 33. A province of ancient Mexico. See Torquemada, <i>Monarquia
Indiana</i>. Lib. II, caps. 53, 56.
</p>
<p>
CULTEPEC, 42. A village five leagues from Tezcuco, at the foot of the
mountains. Deriv., <i>colli</i>, ancestor, <i>tepetl</i>, mountain or town,
with post-pos. <i>c</i>; "at the town of the ancestors."

<p>
HUETLALPAN or HUETLAPALLAN, 89. The original seat of the mythical
Toltecs. The name is a compound of <i>hue</i>, old, and <i>Tlapallan</i>, q. v.

HUEXOTZINCO, 50, 83, 91, 99, 113. An independent State of ancient
Anahuac, south of Tlascala and west of Cholula. The name means "at
the little willow woods," being a diminutive from <i>huexatla</i>, place
of willows.
</p>
<p>
HUITLALOTZIN, 89. From <i>huitlallotl</i>, a species of bird, with the
reverential termination. Name of a warrior.
</p>
<p>
HUITZILAPOCHTLI, 16. Tribal god of the Mexicans of Tenochtitlan. The
name is usually derived from <i>huitzitzilin</i>, humming bird, and
<i>opochtli</i>, left (<i>Cod. Ramirez</i>, p. 22), but more correctly from
<i>huitztli</i>, the south, <i>iloa</i>, to turn, <i>opochtli</i>, the left hand,
"the left hand turned toward the south," as this god directed the
wanderings of the Mexicans southward. The humming bird was used as
the "ikonomatic" symbol of the name.
</p>
<p>
HUITZILIHUITL, 89. "Humming-bird feather." Name of an ancient ruler
of Mexico, and of other warriors.
</p>
<p>

Huitznahua, residents of the quarters so called in Tezcuco and

</p>
<p>
IXTLILXOCHITL, 35, 46, 89. A ruler of Acolhuacan, father of
Nezahualcoyotl. Comp. <i>ixtli</i>, face, <i>tlilxochitl</i>, the vanilla
(literally, the black flower).
</p>
<p>
IZTACCOYOTL, 89, 93. "The white wolf." Name of a warrior otherwise
unknown.
</p>
<p>
MEXICANS, 67, 83, 85, 87, 123, 125. See
</p>
<p>
MEXICO, 83, 123. Name of the town and state otherwise called
Tenochtitlan. <i>Mexitl</i> was one of the names of the national god
Huitzilopochtli, and Mexico means "the place of Mexitl," indicating
that the city was originally called from a fane of the god.
</p>
<p>

the dead."

<i>Motecuhzomatzin</i>, and the meaning, "he who is angry in a noble
manner." ("señor sañudo," <i>Cod. Ramirez</i>, p. 72; "qui se fache en
seigneur," Siméon, <i>Dict. de la Langue Nahuatl</i>, s. v.).
</p>
<p>
MOQUIHUIX, 33. The fourth ruler of Tlatilolco. He assumed the power
in 1441, according to some writers (Bustamente, <i>Tezcoco, en los
Ultimas Tiempos de sus Antiguos Reyes</i>, p. 269). The name probably
means "He who comes forth a freeman." See Ixtlilxochitl, <i>Historia
Chichimeca</i>, caps. 36, 51.
</p>
<p>
NACXITL TOPILTZIN, 105, 107. Nacxitl, "the four footed" (<i>nahui,
ixitl</i>), was the name of one of the gods of the merchants (Sahagun,
<i>Hist, de Nueva España</i>, Lib. I, c. 19). In the song it is applied to
Quetzalcoatl, who was also regarded as a guardian of merchants.
</p>
<p>
NAHUATL, (9, etc.). A term applied to the language otherwise known as
Aztec or Mexican. As an adjective it means "well-sounding," or,
pleasant to the ear. From this, the term <i>Nahua</i> is used collectively
for all tribes who spoke the Nahuatl tongue. <i>Nahuatl</i> also means
clever, skillful, and the derivation is probably from the root <i>na</i>,
to know.

</p>
<p>
NONOHUALCO, 105, 125. Name of one of the quarters of the ancient city
of Mexico; also of a mountain west of the valley of Mexico. The
derivation is probably from <i>onoc</i>, to lie down; <i>onohua</i>, to sleep;
<i>onohuayan</i>, a settled spot, an inhabited place. The <i>co</i> is a
postposition.
</p>
<p>
NOPAL or NOPALTZIN, 46. Ruler of Acolhuacan, A. D. 1260-1263,
according to some chronologies. The name is from <i>nopalli</i>, the
cactus or opuntia.
</p>

 On this subject the reader may consult Parades,

<i>Arte de la Lengua Mexicana</i>, pp. 60, 61. Tapia Zenteno whose <i>Arte
Novissima de la Lengua Mexicana</i> was published in 1753, rejects
altogether the saltillo, and says its invention is of no use except
to make students work harder! (pp. 3, 4.) The vowels with saltillo,
he maintains, are simply to be pronounced with a slight aspiration.
Nevertheless, the late writers continue to employ and describe the
saltillo, as Chimalpopoca, <i>Epitome á Modo Facil de aprender el
Idioma Nahuatl</i>, p. 6. (Mexico, 1869.)

as they say <i>tlapanhuimetzli</i>, half moon. It is described by
Tezozomoc as "un atambor bajo." <i>Cronica Mexicana</i>, cap. 53.
</p>

<p>
<a name="fn28"></a><a href="#fn28_r">[28]</a>

 Simeon, however, thinks the name arose from the growing
and swelling of the sound of the instrument (notes to Jourdanet's
translation of Sahagun, p. 28). Mr. H.H. Bancroft gives the
astonishing translation of teponaztli, "wing of stone vapor!"
(<i>Native Races of the Pacific States</i>, Vol. II, p. 293.) Brasseur
traced the word to a Maya-Quiche root, <i>tep</i>. In both Nahuatl and
Maya this syllable is the radicle of various words meaning to
increase, enlarge, to grow strong or great, etc.

 Carochi's translations are not quite literal. The
following notes will explain the compounds:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. <i>Tlauitl</i>, red ochre, <i>quecholli</i>, a bird so called, <i>aztatl</i>, a
heron, <i>ehualtia</i>, reverential of <i>ehua</i>, to rise up; hence, "It (or
he) shone like a noble red-winged heron rising in flight."</p>
<p>2. <i>Ayauitl</i>, mist; <i>coçamalotl</i>, rainbow; <i>tonameyotl</i>, shining,
brightness; <i>ti</i>, connective; <i>mani</i>, substantive verb. "The
brightness of the rain bow is there." There is no conjunction "and";
Father Carochi seems to have carelessly taken <i>ayauh</i>, which is the
form of <i>ayauitl</i> in composition, for the conjunction <i>auh</i>, and.
Each of the lines given is a detached fragment, without connection
with the others.</p>
<p>3. <i>xiuitl</i>, something blue or green; <i>coyolli</i>, bells;
<i>tzitzilicaliztli</i>, tinkling. "The golden drum's
turquoise-bell-tinkling."</p>
<p>4. <i>xiuhtic</i>, blue or green; <i>tlapalli</i>, red; <i>cuiloa</i>, to paint or
write; <i>amoxtli</i>, book; <i>manca</i>, imperf. of <i>mani</i>. "There was a book
painted in red and green."  5. <i>chalchiuhuitl</i>, the jade; <i>cozcatl</i>,
a jewel; <i>mecatl</i>, a string; <i>totoma</i>, frequentative of <i>toma</i>, to
unfold, unwind. "I unwind my song like a string of precious jewels."

this, as I understand his words, in Spanish only. See his <i>Tezcuco en

Alexander von Humboldt visited Mexico he sought in vain for any

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
